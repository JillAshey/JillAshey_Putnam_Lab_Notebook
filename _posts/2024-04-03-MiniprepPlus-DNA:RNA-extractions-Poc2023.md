# Extractions for Moorea Pocillopora spawning 2023

This protocol is based on Maggie’s coral egg/larvae extraction [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/) and Kevin’s coral larvae extraction [protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Extractions-on-P.-astreoides-larvae-BEAD-BEATING/). This post details the info about the extraction steps for larval *Pocillopora* samples from Moorea 2023. The github for that project is linked [here](https://github.com/hputnam/Pocillopora_Spawning_Moorea). 

### Samples 

The samples run today were 8, 9, 106, 109, 111, and 112. These samples had ~400 ul of larvae per tube and were preserved in 500 uL of DNA/RNA Shield. They were transported in a freezer box that also included formalin-fixed samples and were stored at 4°C for ~3 months. This photo is post-bead beating:

### Materials 

- Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit [HERE](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) Protocol Booklet
- Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1X buffer for DNA elution
- Heating block capable of heating to 70ºC
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Plastics 
	- 3 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample
	- 2 PCR tubes per sample
	- 2 Qubit tubes per sample 
	- 1 5 mL tube per sample 

### Protocol

Protocol was followed according to this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-07-21-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae.md). A few differences: 

- I added 500 uL of DNA/RNA shield to the samples after thawing them so that the volume in the tubes was ~1 mL of shield. I aliquoted out 500 uL for extractions and saved the remaining fraction in case we need to re-extract. 
- In the RNA extraction, I added another wash step with 400 uL of wash buffer after the DNase incubation (i.e., after the incubation, I did 400 uL of prep buffer, 700 uL of wash buffer, 400 uL of wash buffer, and another 400 uL of wash buffer).
- I eluted in 80 uL of either Tris (DNA) or DNA/RNA free water (RNA) instead of 100 uL. 
- In the second extraction of the day, I tipped the RNA samples onto the floor when trying to close lids to the caps. This was during the second incubation for RNA elution. 

### QC 

All QC was run the same day as extractions.

#### Gel

There are very very very faint bands in the RNA samples for the last 4 samples. I did not get Qubit values for the last 2 samples but hopefully will get tapestation concentrations for them. 

#### Tapestation 

See full tapestation report [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/tapestation/RNA_POC_2024-04-03.pdf).

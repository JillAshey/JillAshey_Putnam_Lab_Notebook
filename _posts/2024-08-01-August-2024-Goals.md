4. e5 ncRNA intro and results  
5. Write postdoc blurbs and send 

### Sample processing

1. Send Mcap 2023 samples for sequencing 
2. Re-amp 6 WGBS e5 deep dive samples
3. Clip and re-extract 8 samples for e5  
4. Find and send RNA samples for e5 
5. WGBS library prep for e5 samples  
6. Phys stuff for AST and Mcap DT ? 

### Data analysis

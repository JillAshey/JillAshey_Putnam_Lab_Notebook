## August reflection

How did I do with my goals for this month?   

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. Dissertation proposal submission to grad school - nope lol
2. Complete Pacuta 2022 manuscript edits and send to co-authors - yes! On desks of HP, TM, and AH 
3. Resubmission of Astrangia review - yes! Currently in review at Biology Letters 
4. e5 ncRNA intro and results - yes! Waiting on lncRNA stuff 
5. Write postdoc blurbs and send - sort of! Emails have been sent 

### Sample processing

1. Send Mcap 2023 samples for sequencing - yes! 
2. Re-amp 6 WGBS e5 deep dive samples - tried a few times but unsuccessful. Need to nanodrop DNA and libraries before next steps 
3. Clip and re-extract 8 samples for e5 - yes
4. Find and send RNA samples for e5 - yes
5. WGBS library prep for e5 samples - no, decided to send them out for library prep
6. Phys stuff for AST and Mcap DT - no

### Data analysis

1. 3'UTR for AST 2021 and rerun miRanda with that info - no, having issues with installing gene ext 
2. Apul methylation - sort of? ran fuzznuc which identified CpG motifs in assembled genome 

### Field work / travel 

1. Submit BIOS TAR - yes 
2. Check out dive at URI - yes

Pretty happy with all that I accomplished in August! Things are moving forward.

# MagBead DNA/RNA extraction protocol trial  

## Goal: Extract DNA and RNA from coral fragment clipping using Zymo MagBead kit 

The Quick-DNA/RNA MagBead kit uses magnetic bead-based isolation of RNA and DNA. The Putnam lab has not used this kit yet, so I may have to do some troubleshooting. 

These extractions were done with the species *Astrangia poculata* from a 2021 intra-generational thermal stress experiment. 

### Samples 

Samples that I used today: 

- AST-2360
- AST-1409 (or 1499?? need to double check)
- AST-1288
- AST-2873

These samples were flash frozen, clipped, and put in 1.5 mL bead tube in 1 mL of DNA/RNA shield.

### Materials 

- Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA MagBead kit [HERE](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_r2130_r2131_quick-dna_rna_magbead.pdf) Protocol booklet 
- Magnetic 1.5 mL tube rack 
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Plastics 
	- 5 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample
	- 2 PCR tubes per sample
	- Several 1000 uL, 200 uL, and 20 uL filtered pipette tips per sample.

Reagents were prepared in March 2022 by HP & JA. They are stored at -20°C in a freezer box labeled "MagBead Reagents"

## Protocol 

### Working area sterilization 

- Clean bench with clean paper towels (spray solution, wipe down) in the following order:
	- 10% bleach solution
	- DI water
	- 70% ethanol
	- RNAse cleaner (spray bottle)
- Clean pipettes, tip boxes, and the controls on the heating block and centrifuge by squirting 70% ethanol on a paper towel and wiping them down. Repeat with RNAse cleaner. 
- Wipe down gloves with 70% ethanol and RNAse cleaner. 
- Do not spray solutions directly on the equipment.

### Reagent preparation 

This only needs to be done if a new kit is being opened. 

ADD INFO

### Sample prep 

- Take out tubes and leave on benchtop to thaw 
- Take a picture of the tubes to document buffer color and amount of tissue in each tube 
- Label new 1.5 mL tubes w/ sample ID
- Bead beat for 1 minute at max speed 
	- Did not aliquot from original tube, but I think I should have 

### Prot-K digestion 

- Using the PK digestion buffer (stored in -20°C) from the kit, add 10 μL into each sample tube for every 200 μL (1:10 ratio of PK Digestion Buffer:Sample)
	- I think I added too little PK digestion buffer to each sample. I needed to aliquot the samples out from the bead tubes before adding the Prot-K.
- Vortex samples and let them sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes 
- Invert and do a quick spin in the mini-centrifuge 
- Aliquot 200 μL into new 1.5 mL tube
- Centrifuge for 1:30 minutes at 15,000 rct
- Transfer supernatent into new 1.5 mL tube 

### Lysis & magnetic bead addition 

- Add 500 μL of DNA/RNA lysis buffer and spin in mini-centrifuge for 30 seconds 
- Add 400 μL of 100% ethanol to the sample and vortex 
- Add 30 μL of MagBinding Beads and mix well for 20 minutes 
	- During this step, the cap on AST-1288 was not properly on so some of the sample sprayed out. Can't continue using this sample anymore in the extraction 
- After mixing, put the tubes on the magnetic rack and wait until the beads pellet along the side. The DNA is attached to the pellets, and the supernatent is the RNA
- Move RNA supernatent to new tube 

I don't think I washed the DNA/RNA correctly for this extraction. I totally skipped the total nucleic acid purification step (step III in Zymo protocol) because that's what I did in March 2022. 

### DNA extractions

- Add 500 μL of MagBead DNA/RNA Wash 1 to tube with the beads (DNA). Vortex until the beads/pellet is mixed into the liquid. Put back onto magnetic stand and pellet the beads. Discard the supernatent 
	- Pelleting takes up to 5 minutes, but usually 1-2 minutes 
	- Some beads will adhere to sides of the tube. When removing the supernatent, aspirate (act of withdrawing the fluid through the pipette) slowly to allow these beads to be pulled to the magnet as the liquid level is lowered
- Add 500 μL of MagBead DNA/RNA Wash 2 to tube with the beads (DNA). Vortex until the beads/pellet is mixed into the liquid. Put back onto magnetic stand and pellet the beads. Discard the supernatent 
- Add 500 μL of 100% ethanol to tube with the beads (DNA). Vortex until the beads/pellet is mixed into the liquid. Put back onto magnetic stand and pellet the beads. Discard the supernatent. **Do this TWICE!!!!!**
- Dry the beads for 10 minutes (I left the caps on the tubes during the drying)
- Add 50 μL of DNase/RNase Free Water and mix well for 5 minutes. Pellet the beads, aspirate, and move the supernatent into final 1.5 mL labeled gDNA tube 
	- 1409/1499 looks very foamy, not sure why. Couldn't get a lot of liquid from it 

### RNA extractions

- Add 700 μL of 100% ethanol to the RNA tubes and mix well 
- Add 30 μL of MagBinding Beads and mix well for 10 minutes 
- Transfer tubes to magnetic stand until beads have pelleted, then aspirate and discard the supernatent 
- Add 500 μL of MagBead DNA/RNA Wash 1 to tubes with the beads (RNA). Vortex until the beads/pellet is mixed into the liquid. Put back onto magnetic stand and pellet the beads. Discard the supernatent 
- Add 500 μL of MagBead DNA/RNA Wash 2 to tubes with the beads (RNA). Vortex until the beads/pellet is mixed into the liquid. Put back onto magnetic stand and pellet the beads. Discard the supernatent 
- Add 500 μL of 100% ethanol to tube with the beads (RNA). Vortex until the beads/pellet is mixed into the liquid. Put back onto magnetic stand and pellet the beads. Discard the supernatent. **Do this TWICE!!!!!**
- Add 50 μL DNase I Reaction mix and gently mix for 10 minutes
- Add 500 μL of DNA/RNA Prep Buffer and mix well for 10 minutes. Put back onto magnetic stand and pellet the beads. Discard the supernatent. **Do this TWICE!!!!!**
- Dry the beads for 10 minutes (I left the caps on the tubes during the drying)
- Add 50 μL of DNase/RNase Free Water and mix well for 5 minutes. Pellet the beads, aspirate, and move the supernatent into final 1.5 mL labeled RNA tube 

## Quality Control 

### Qubit 

I followed this Qubit protocol (add here xxxx) for DNA/RNA quantity assessment.

| Tube          | Tyoe     | DNA 1 (ng/L) | DNA 2 (ng/L) | RNA 1 (ng/L) | RNA 2 (ng/L) |

| S1            | Standard | 189.65       |              | 462.79       |              |
| S2            | Standard | 39772.31     |              | 10112.53     |              |

No DNA/RNA detected here. Sadness 

### Gel 

I followed this protocol (add here xxxx) for making the gel. 

- Ran for 60 minutes at 60 volts

No clear bands appear on the gel

4. e5 ncRNA results 
5. Write postdoc blurbs and send 

### Sample processing

1. Re-amp 12 remaining miRNA Mcap 2023 samples 
2. Re-amp 6 WGBS e5 deep dive samples - order more enzymes 
3. Phys stuff for AST and Mcap DT ? 

### Data analysis

1. 3'UTR for AST 2021 and rerun miRanda with that info 
2. Start Apul structural and functional annotation 
3. Catch up on e5 analysis 

### Field work / travel 

1. Flo experiment at BIOS 
2. Research diving course at BIOS (June 23 - July 13)

Will be taking a vacation in NJ with family from July 14-20.

## July reflection

How did I do with my goals for this month?   

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. Dissertation proposal submission to grad school - need to do this lolololol. 
2. Complete Pacuta 2022 manuscript edits and send to co-authors - kinda? I redid the analyses with GO MWU and am rewriting discussion now 
3. Resubmission of Astrangia review - in the process of adding recently published papers 
4. e5 ncRNA results - sort of? miRNA and piRNA seem to be going well 
5. Write postdoc blurbs and send - nopeeeeee

### Sample processing

1. Re-amp 12 remaining miRNA Mcap 2023 samples - yes, success! 
2. Re-amp 6 WGBS e5 deep dive samples - order more enzymes - more enzyme arrived today
3. Phys stuff for AST and Mcap DT - bope 

### Data analysis

1. 3'UTR for AST 2021 and rerun miRanda with that info - nope
2. Start Apul structural and functional annotation - Trinity and I met, she will be working on funannotate and I will be looking into methylation tools for pacbio reads 
3. Catch up on e5 analysis 

### Field work / travel 

1. Flo experiment at BIOS - done
2. Research diving course at BIOS (June 23 - July 13) - done

## Goals  

### Writing and manuscripts 
              
1. Full draft of dissertation proposal
2. Write physiological results for Astrangia 2021 experiment 
3. Resubmit Astrangia review manuscript 
4. Finish intro and methods for e5 ncRNA paper 
5. Diversity statement for dissertation proposal

### Sample processing

1. Finish miRNA library prep (8 samples) 
2. Library prep for WGBS (27 samples)
3. Carbs for DT samples 
4. Extractions, library prep, lipid extraction when AH is here

### Data analysis
1. Finish stats for Astrangia 2021 phys data (carbs)
2. Work on Astrangia 2021 mRNA functional enrichment analysis 
3. Run DESeq2 on miRNAs 
4. Continue with genome assembly for Apul 
5. Troubleshoot Pacuta goseq 
6. Test miranda

### March 6

- Looked at viral contam, still waiting for prok to finish 
- miRNA library prep section 1, 2, 3
- Worked on e5 ncRNA intro 
- Gathering protein sequence info re ncRNA machinery 
- Lab meeting

### March 7

- miRNA library prep section 4 + QC 
- GOSeq for Pacuta HI 2022 
- Ordered dry ice 
- Started making sample submission sheet 

### March 8 

- Goseq and biomin analysis for Pacuta 
- Meeting with Caroline 
- e5 ncRNA meeting 
- Serena defense 

### March 9 

- Writing a little for Pacuta paper 

### March 11

- Worked on intro/discussion for Pacuta paper 
- Restarted prok blast script 
- Interpreted hifiasm output (contam sequences not removed)
- Ran Busco for hifiasm assembled contigs 
- Functional enrichment + biomin analysis + figure making for Pacuta paper - got lots done today
- Looked at busco results - much better than canu, hifiasm is the way to go for assembly with this data 
- Blast for Pacuta and Spist subset biomin genes

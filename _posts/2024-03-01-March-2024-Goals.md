2. Write physiological results for Astrangia 2021 experiment 
3. Resubmit Astrangia review manuscript 
4. Finish intro and methods for e5 ncRNA paper 
5. Diversity statement for dissertation proposal

### Sample processing

1. Finish miRNA library prep (8 samples) 
2. Library prep for WGBS (27 samples)
3. Carbs for DT samples 
4. Extractions, library prep, lipid extraction when AH is here

### Data analysis
1. Finish stats for Astrangia 2021 phys data (carbs)
2. Work on Astrangia 2021 mRNA functional enrichment analysis 
3. Run DESeq2 on miRNAs 
4. Continue with genome assembly for Apul 
5. Troubleshoot Pacuta goseq 
6. Test miranda 

## Daily log 

### March 1

- Section 1 miRNA library prep test with 2 samples 
- Worked on dissertation proposal hypotheses 
- Read methods of new Ofav PacBio genome paper !!!!!
- Read Zoe methods proposal 
- GSA event
- Raw read length analysis for Apul genome 
- Finished writing switchfree protocol
- Made OSF repo for Apul genome

### March 3

- Rest of miRNA library prep test with 2 samples + QC 
- Worked on dissertation proposal + appendices 
- Ran euk contaminant read identifier

### March 4

- Looked at contaminant euk output 
- miRNA library prep with 2 samples + QC 
- Emailed Kevin Bryan re CPC2 and viral/prok genomes on Andromeda 
- Worked on dissertation proposal 
- Edited Astrangia review figure + manuscript
- Restarted hifiasm 
- Worked on writing up pico protocol 
- Qubit on miRNA libraries 
- Writing up miRNA library prep posts 

### March 5

- Prepped tubes for miRNA library prep tomorrow
- Moved RiboFree libraries into tubes to send to sequencer 
- Wrote up rest of pico protocol
- Cleaned and swapped out egg crate for BT 3/4
- Lab meeting 
- Made miRNA gene count matrix!!!!!! and combined it with info about filtered novel and known miRNAs
- DIBP workshop 
- Cleaning up miRNA R code 
- Prok and viral blast against Apul hifi reads

### March 6

- Looked at viral contam, still waiting for prok to finish 
- miRNA library prep section 1, 2, 3
- Worked on e5 ncRNA intro 
- Gathering protein sequence info re ncRNA machinery 
- Lab meeting

### March 7

- miRNA library prep section 4 + QC 
- GOSeq for Pacuta HI 2022 
- Ordered dry ice

- Serena defense 

### March 9 

- Writing a little for Pacuta paper 

### March 11

- Worked on intro/discussion + results for Pacuta paper 
- Restarted prok blast script 
- Interpreted hifiasm output (contam sequences not removed)
- Ran Busco for hifiasm assembled contigs 
- Functional enrichment + biomin analysis + figure making for Pacuta paper - got lots done today
- Looked at busco results - much better than canu, hifiasm is the way to go for assembly with this data

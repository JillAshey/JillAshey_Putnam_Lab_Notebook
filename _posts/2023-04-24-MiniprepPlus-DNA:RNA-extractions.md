# Extractions for Astrangia 2021 experiment

This protocol is based on those from [E. Strand](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol.md), [K. Wong](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-13-Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extract-P.astreoides-Genome.md), [E. Chille](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/), [K. Terpis](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/), & [Z. Delleart](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/). 

### Samples 

Samples that I used today: 

- AST-2360
- AST-2375

Samples were flash frozen, clipped, and put in 1.5 mL bead tube in 1 mL of DNA/RNA shield. I attempted to extract DNA/RNA from AST-2360 using the MagBead kit, but was unsuccessful. See post [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-10-03_MagBead-Extractions.md). 

### Materials 

- Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit [HERE](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) Protocol Booklet
- Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1X buffer for DNA elution
- Heating block capable of heating to 70ºC
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Plastics 
	- 5 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample
	- 2 PCR tubes per sample
	- Several 1000 uL, 200 uL, and 20 uL filtered pipette tips per sample.

### Protocol 

Before extractions, I bead beat samples, as they were already in bead tubes

- Bead beat for 1 minute at max speed 
- Quick spin down in smol centrifuge 
- Transfer 400 μL into new tube. 
- Centrifuge for 3 minutes at 9000 rct
- Transfer 300 μL into new tube

Used this [protocol](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-10-25-MiniprepPlus-DNA:RNA-extractions.md) (mine) for extractions and QC. 

### Quality Control 

QC was done on 4/25/23.

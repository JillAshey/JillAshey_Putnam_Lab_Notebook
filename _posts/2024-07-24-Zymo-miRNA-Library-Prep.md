# miRNA library prep for Mcap developmental time series Hawaii 2023

This post details the info about the miRNA library prep steps for the *M. capitata* developmental time series experiment in Hawaii 2023. The github for that project is linked [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/Hawaii_Developmental_TimeSeries). I'm using the [Zymo-Seq miRNA library kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-mirna-library-kit) for small RNA library prep (I got the 12 prep kit). See Zymo's protocol [here](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/r3006_r3007-zymo-seq_mirna_library_kit.pdf). 

After sequencing n=1 from each time point from the Mcap 2023 project, we decided to move forward with sequencing n=3 from each time point in the ambient. I need to miRNA library prep 24 more samples. Today, I re-amped samples M8, M14, M28, M39, M48, M51, M61, M63, M74, M75, M87, and M88. M8, M14, M28, M48, and M51 were extracted on [2/22/24](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-02-22-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae-DT.md) and M39, M61, M63, M74, M75, M87, and M88 were extracted on [5/2/24](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-05-02-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae-DT.md). 

I received new TaqPreMix from Zymo so I redid sections 4, 5, and QC on 7/24/24. 

Here's the miRNA library prep workflow:

### Materials 

- [Zymo-Seq miRNA library kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-mirna-library-kit)
- PCR tubes 
- Thermocycler 
- Heating block 
- Mini centrifuge
- Bench top centrifuge  
- Aluminum beads (to keep things on ice)
- Magnetic stand for PCR tubes 
- Kit contents

### Materials 

Protocol was followed according to this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-01-09-Zymo-miRNA-Library-Prep.md). A few differences: 

- I received new TaqPreMix from Zymo so I redid sections 4, 5, and QC on 7/24/24. 

### QC 

Run [DNA Tapestation](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-30-DNA-Tapestation.md) for visualize libraries. Here's an example of what the library should look like on a Tapestation:

See full sample report [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/tapestation/DNA_miRNA_2024-07-24.pdf). 

Much better!!! New Taq mix was the way to go. Some samples have two peaks so I think I will do a bead cleanup before sending.

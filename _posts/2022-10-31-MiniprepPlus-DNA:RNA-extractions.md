# Extractions for Astrangia 2021 experiment

Extracting from the samples from the Astrangia 2021 experiment. In this extraction, I also extracted 2 of ZD's Bermuda samples to give myself a positive control. I wanted to see how my extractions would look using the MiniPrep kit instead of the MagBead kit. 

This protocol is based on those from [E. Strand](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol.md), [K. Wong](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-13-Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extract-P.astreoides-Genome.md), [E. Chille](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/), [K. Terpis](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/), & [Z. Delleart](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/). 

### Samples 

Samples that I used today: 

- AST-1772 (JA)
- AST-1826 (JA)
- E1 (ZD)
- A7 (ZD)

JA samples were flash frozen, clipped, and put in 1.5 mL bead tube in 1 mL of DNA/RNA shield. ZD samples were clipped and put in DNA/RNA shield. E1 and A7 were already extracted by ZD, but I wanted a positive control.

### Materials 

- Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit [HERE](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) Protocol Booklet
- Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1X buffer for DNA elution
- Heating block capable of heating to 70ºC
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Plastics 
	- 5 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample
	- 2 PCR tubes per sample
	- Several 1000 uL, 200 uL, and 20 uL filtered pipette tips per sample.

### Protocol 

Before extractions, I bead beat the JA samples, as they were already in bead tubes

- Bead beat for 1 minute at max speed 
- Quick spin down in smol centrifuge 
- Transfer 400 μL into new tube. 
- Centrifuge for 3 minutes at 9000 rct
- Transfer 300 μL into new tube

Used this [protocol](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-10-25-MiniprepPlus-DNA:RNA-extractions.md) (mine) for extractions and QC. 

### Quality Control 

#### Qubit results 

| Tube     | Type     | DNA 1 (ng/L) | DNA 2 (ng/L) | RNA 1 (ng/L) | RNA 2 (ng/L) |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| S1       | Standard | 197.6        |              | 409.86       |              |
| S2       | Standard | 22651.76     |              | 9163.11      |              |
| AST-1772 | Sample   | 216          | 210          | 310          | 308          |
| AST-1826 | Sample   | 12.4         | 12.1         | 25.8         | 25.4         |
| E1       | Sample   | 7.94         | 7.84         | 23.6         | 23.2         |
| A7       | Sample   | 10.2         | 10.1         | 12.6         | 12.4         |


I am pretty happy with these results! I'm not sure why AST-1772 values is crazy high. But I got a good amount from each sample!

## How did I do on my goals for this month?  

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. e5 ncRNA complete draft of manuscript submit to biorxiv - nope, basically done though 
2. Pacuta manuscript submit to biorixiv - nope, very close to being done. Hollie has now done all of her edits 
3. Results for Mcap 2023 - no writing, just data analysis

### Sample processing

1. Send WGBS e5 deep dive samples - yes Zoe sent while I was away
2. Process e5 timeseries samples for lipids + metabolites - yes, about halfway done 

### Data analysis

1. Rerun cutadapt for Mcap data - yes
2. Rerun mirdeep2 for Mcap - yes
3. Identify 3'UTRs for Mcap -yes
4. Run miranda with Mcap data - yes
5. Run mirtarrnaseq or mirDREM for Mcap data - yes, mirtarrnaseq
6. Work on SICB presentation - yes

### Field work / travel 

1. Book flights for sicb - yes
2. CBASS workshop! - yes!!!!! Super great workshop, very glad that I went 

My Mcap data for sicb still doesn't look amazing, but we are moving forward. The CBASS workshop was a wonderful experience, I am very glad that I went. Hopefully in 2025, I will have some more first author papers.

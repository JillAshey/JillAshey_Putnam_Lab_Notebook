## Goal: Collect *Astrangia poculata* for a summer 2022 histology time series 

##### Link to diving schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10f1GkQofZL0gtqKkC2G3_hcTQN3dvPheQoQHUGb9BK8/edit#gid=0)

I am interested in monitoring the gamete development of *A. poculata* by the week during the summer. At the end of July and into August, *A. poculata* release their eggs and sperm, but no one knows exactly when spawning occurs. 

20% Zfix will be used throughout. It is toxic, so please wear gloves when handling anything with Zfix and dispose of the gloves in the proper waste container. Let me know if you aren't comfortable handling Zfix. 

### Before diving: 

Coordinate with your dive budy on what day/time you will dive. 

- Locate the white Putnam lab cooler. On the top of the cooler is written 20% Zfix and No Live Animals. It should be on the red shelving or under the old Thornber hood.
- Check the contents of the cooler. Inside the cooler, there should be a 50mL falcon tube rack, sharpie, white tape, 500mL bottle of Zfix (may not be full), extra unlabeled 50mL tubes, parafilm, and a ziplock bag with waste label saying 'Solid waste with residual 20% Zfix in FSW'. 
	- If any of these items are not in the cooler, find them and put them in the cooler. Info on where to find the Zfix is below
- Label 10 50mL falcon tubes with AP1-10, the date of collection, your initials and Zfix. 
- Put your labeled tubes in the tube rack and carry the tube rack to the PPP labs. 
- Get out the Zfix and put it in the hood. 
	- The Zfix is in the bottom cabinet to the left of the PPP labs chemical hood. It is in a jug labeled '20% Zfix in filtered seawater'. There is also a large container of concentrated Zfix. 
- Using a funnel, fill each labeled falcon tube with 20-25 mL of Zfix. It doesn't have to be exact, you can just pour it. 
- Put the tubes and the rack in the white cooler. 
- Take the cooler to GSO with you when you go diving. 
- Double check with Emma and/or Anya that you are on the Putnam Lab diving plan. 

### During diving: 

**MAKE SURE YOU HAVING A DIVING BUDDY! DO NOT DIVE ALONE!** 

- Meet at GSO dive locker and get the equipment for coral collecting (hammer, chisel, buckey, mesh bag). 
- I would prefer that you collect from Fort Wetherill, but if diving conditions aren't ideal or you are short on time, collection from GSO is good too. 
- Collect 15-20 corals that will fit in the 50mL falcon tubes. Try to collect half white colonies and half brown colonies. If you can't find any brown corals, all white corals is fine with me. 
- Get out of the water and high-five your dive buddy.

### After diving: 

- Once you have gotten out of the water and rinsed your gear, put the colonies in the 50mL tubes of Zfix in the white cooler. You can put multiple colonies in one tube. 
	- When putting the corals in the Zfix, plop the coral in inside the white cooler so that no Zfix will splash. 
	- Please wear gloves when you do this!! Gloves can be found in Blount 104 (Putnam lab space) at GSO. 
- Take the white cooler back to CBLS. Put the tubes in the non-flammable fridge (labeled fridge D). 
- Put the white cooler under the old Thornber hood. 

You are the best!!!! Thank you :) If you have any questions, let me know!

## Goal: Create workflow for using Olympus V200 slide scanner at Brown

The [Olympus VS200 Slide Scanner](https://biomedcorefacilities.brown.edu/bioimaging-facility/olympus-vs200-slide-scanner) is located at Brown University. It is an automated slide scanner for imaging H&E slides. This system is ideally suited for imaging a large field of view at high resolution.

### Before: 

- Contact Geoff Williams (manager of the facility; email xxxx) to see if the scanner is available, as well as set up payment methods and other logistics (cc Hollie on these emails). 
- Schedule a time to complete slide scanner training with Geoff - this needs to be done before using the slide scanner independently. 
- Slide scanner is in Sidney Frank Hall for Life Sciences, BioMedCenter, room BMC 005. Building & slide scanner room require swipe access w/ Brown ID. 
	- Get a temporary Brown ID (talk to Geoff) or have one of the Brown researchers let you in (which is a little annoying, I would just try to get the ID). 
- Make account and sign up for slide scanner sessions on [iLabs](https://brown.ilab.agilent.com/landing/1314 
). You need to make an account so that you can start/end your sessions when working with the slide scanner. To make a reservation: 
	- After making an account, click log in on top right corner. 
	- It will ask you if you are not a Brown University user. Check the box next to Login using iLab credentials. 
	- enter username and password. 
	- Click on the 3 horizontal lines in the top left corner and click core facilities. 
	- This will take you to a page saying 'There are no cores associated with this selection. Click here to view cores at other institutions.' URI doesn't have any cores associated with this platform. Click 'here' to see the  cores at other institutions
	- A lot of different core options will come up. To find Brown, search the table for Brown using top right search bar.
	- You will see Brown University and under that 'Bioimaging Facility'. Click on that.
	- This will take you to the equipment reservation page for the Brown Bioimaging Facility. To find the slide scanner, click the SFH Fluorescence drop down option. 
	- You will now see the Olympus VS200 Slide Scanner option. Click on that.
	- This will take you to the slide scanner schedule. To make a reservation, find your desired date and time and double click in the calender. A box will pop up that allows you to make a reservation. 
	- Under reservation details, it should say: self use $42.00/hr (trained), Lab: Putnam, Hollie (URI) lab. In event notes, add your name, the names of anyone that will be with you, and URI.
 	- Under Times: choose a start and end date. You can always change or delete the reservation, if needed. 
 	- Under Use and cost of reservation: it will tell you the hourly rate that will be charged to us for using the slide scanner. The rate for external researchers is $42/hr. 
 	- Under Payment information: Enter Lab PI name (Hollie Putnam).
 	- Click save reservation. 
- Get a hard drive, preferably one that has >1TB storage. These files are really big (about 2MB per slide). 
- Organize slides beforehand and make a plan about which ones you will scan during your session. 

### During 

#### Turning on 

- Turn on/log on to computer (labeled 1)
	- you should get a username and password when training with Geoff. MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THIS!!!!!!! Or else you will get to the facility and be unable to log in to the computer and access the slide scanner software. 
- Turn on Olympus Slideview VS200 (labeled 2)
- Turn on camera, the switch is on top of slide scanner (labeled 3)
- Turn on X-cite Xylis, next to computer under table (labeled 4)
- Check there is green light lit up next to each tray in slide loader. If not, open door and properly align trays before starting software. 
- Start kiosk session in iLabs (**add info**)
- Plug in the hard drive to the computer.
- Start Olympus VS200 ASW software

#### Loading slides 

- Once the software, opens, click on Expert Batch
- Click Exchange Trays. The door should unlock.
- Open the door and remove the trays 
- Load trays. **add pictures**
- Put trays back in scanner. If the trays are properly sitting in the scanning, a green light will turn on next to each tray. If the green light does not turn on, readjust the slide until it does.
- Close the door. All trays should have green light next to them
- Click lock door 
- The software should recognize the trays with the slides on them. Make sure it recognizes all trays and slides before proceeding

#### Scanning

There are lots of different scanning settings for this software. Read the manual beforehand to decide what settings would be best for your specific project. This protocol is specific to the Astrangia 2021 project. 

- After the slides are loaded, you should be in the Scan Project tab (see tabs in the top right hand of screen). Click on Gallery (top left of screen). Click select all to scan all slides
- Click on the overview tab. Make a project for scanning. I like to make a new project each time I use the slide scanner. Name the new project the date.
- In the detail tab, click scan overview to do initial scan of all slides. The initial scan is done to xxxxx. It should be about 40 frames per slide. This will take a few mins. 
- After the initial scan is complete, go back to the overview tab 
- Click on name and saving 
- Click the wheel next to the image name 
- Click add text and write the sample ID and timepoint 
- Add sample ID/timepoint to the image name
- Remove all other identifiers from image name
- Save to hard drive under directory 
- Name images and save to hard drive for all slides 
- In the detail tab, click scan areas
- Click scan. For scan area creation, select one for each subsample. This will make focus boxes around the important parts of the slide. If needed, you can move the boxes around, make them larger/smaller, or add/delete boxes.
- Go to Gallery and do the same scan area for all slides. 
- Once all slides are named and the scan areas are created, click start scan
- Slides are now scanning! It will take a few mins per slide

#### Shutting down

- After all slides have successfully scanned, check to make sure everything is SAVED to your hard drive. DO NOT save anything on the slide scanner computer. 
- End kiosk session in iLabs
- If someone else is signed up after you on the slide scanner: 
	- Log off computer 
	- Fill out logbook (next to computer)
- If you are the last person for the day:
	- Shut down computer (either on the screen or labeled 1)
	- Turn off X-cite Xylis (labeled 4)
	- Turn off camera (labeled 3)
	- Turn off slide scanner (labeled 2)
	- Fill out logbook

##### Parking!!!

I am a very anxious parker, so here is some parking info: 

- Brown has visitor parking (111 Power St, Providence) in Power Street Parking Garage. If you park here, you have to pay and put the ticket on your car's windshield. It's ~15 min walk from the parking garage to the building (map below).

- There is also metered parking in and around Brown campus, but it can be tricky to find. 
- More info on visitor and street parking [here](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/transportation/about/visitor-parking).

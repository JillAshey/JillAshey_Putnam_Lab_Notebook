### Before: 

- Contact Geoff Williams (manager of the facility; email xxxx) to set up payment methods and other logistics. Schedule a time to complete slide scanner training with Geoff - this needs to be done before using. 
- Slide scanner is in Sidney Frank Hall for Life Sciences, BioMedCenter, room BMC 005. Building & slide scanner room require swipe access w/ Brown ID. 
	- Get a temporary Brown ID (talk to Geoff) or have one of the Brown researchers let you in (which is a little annoying, I would just try to get the ID). 
- Make account and sign up for slide scanner sessions on [iLabs](https://brown.ilab.agilent.com/landing/1314 
). You need to make an account so that you can start/end your sessions when working with the slide scanner. To make a reservation: 
	- After making an account, click log in on top right corner. 
	- It will ask you if you are not a Brown University user. Check the box next to Login using iLab credentials. 
	- enter username and password. 
	- Click on the 3 horizontal lines in the top left corner and click core facilities. 
	- This will take you to a page saying 'There are no cores associated with this selection. Click here to view cores at other institutions.' URI doesn't have any cores associated with this platform. Click 'here' to see the  cores at other institutions
	- A lot of different core options will come up. To find Brown, search the table for Brown using top right search bar.
	- You will see Brown University and under that 'Bioimaging Facility'. Click on that.
	- This will take you to the equipment reservation page for the Brown Bioimaging Facility. To find the slide scanner, click the SFH Fluorescence drop down option. 
	- You will now see the Olympus VS200 Slide Scanner option. Click on that.
	- This will take you to the slide scanner schedule. To make a reservation, find your desired date and time and double click in the calender. A box will pop up that allows you to make a reservation. 
	- Under reservation details, it should say: self use $42.00/hr (trained), Lab: Putnam, Hollie (URI) lab. In event notes, add your name, the names of anyone that will be with you, and URI.
 	- Under Times: choose a start and end date. You can always change or delete the reservation, if needed. 
 	- Under Use and cost of reservation: it will tell you the hourly rate that will be charged to us for using the slide scanner. The rate for external researchers is $42/hr. 
 	- Under Payment information: Enter Lab PI name (Hollie Putnam).
 	- Click save reservation. 
- Get a hard drive, preferably one that has >1TB storage. These files are really big (about 2MB per slide). 
- Organize slides beforehand and make a plan about which ones you will scan during your session. 

### During 

#### Turning on 

- Turn on/log on to computer (labeled 1)
	- you should get a username and password when training with Geoff. MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THIS!!!!!!! Or else you will get to the facility and be unable to log in to the computer and access the slide scanner software. 
- Turn on Olympus Slideview VS200 (labeled 2)
- Turn on camera, the switch is on top of slide scanner (labeled 3)
- Turn on X-cite Xylis, next to computer under table (labeled 4)
- Check there is green light lit up next to each tray in slide loader. If not, open door and properly align trays before starting software.

#### Loading slides 

#### Scanning

#### Shutting down

#####Parking!!!

I am a very anxious parker, so here is some parking info: 

- Brown has visitor parking (111 Power St, Providence) in Power Street Parking Garage. If you park here, you have to pay and put the ticket on your car's windshield. It's ~15 min walk from the parking garage to the building (map below).

- There is also metered parking in and around Brown campus, but it can be tricky to find. 
- More info on visitor and street parking [here](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/transportation/about/visitor-parking).

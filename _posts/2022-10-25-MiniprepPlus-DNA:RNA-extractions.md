# Training on Zymo Miniprep Plus kit  

## Goal: Learn how to use Zymo Miniprep Plus kit for DNA/RNA coral extractions 

Trained with K. Terpis as she extracted E5 samples using protocols modified from [Emma Strand](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol.md), [Kevin Wong](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-13-Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extract-P.astreoides-Genome.md), & [Erin Chille](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/).

### Materials 

- Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit [HERE](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) Protocol Booklet
- Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1X buffer for DNA elution
- Heating block capable of heating to 70ºC
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Plastics 
	- 5 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample
	- 2 PCR tubes per sample
	- Several 1000 uL, 200 uL, and 20 uL filtered pipette tips per sample.

## Protocol 

### Working area sterilization 

- Clean bench with clean paper towels (spray solution, wipe down) in the following order:
	- 10% bleach solution
	- DI water
	- 70% ethanol
	- RNAse cleaner (spray bottle)
- Clean pipettes, tip boxes, and the controls on the heating block and centrifuge by squirting 70% ethanol on a paper towel and wiping them down. Repeat with RNAse cleaner. 
- Wipe down gloves with 70% ethanol and RNAse cleaner. 
- Do not spray solutions directly on the equipment.

### Reagent preparation 

This only needs to be done if a new kit is being opened. 

- Add 96 mL 100% ethanol to the 24 mL DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate before use. Mark clearly on the bottle that Ethanol was added. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps.
- Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) DNase I as indicated on the vial prior to use. For 250U of DNAse I, add 275 uL of DNAse/RNAse free water (provided). For 50U of DNAse I, add 55 uL of DNAse/RNAse free water (provided). Mix by gentle inversion. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps. Separate into 3-4 aliquots to minimize freeze-thaw and store at -20 ºC.
- Reconstitute the lyophilized (freeze-dried) Proteinase K as indicated on the vial prior to use. For 20g Proteinase K, add 1040 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. For 5 mg Proteinase K, add 260 uL Proteinase K Storage Buffer. Mix by vortexing. Check kit contents and instructions to confirm prep steps. Store tube at -20 ºC, no need to aliquot.

### Sample prep 

The samples that KT was working with were E5 clippings of coral fragments in DNA/RNA shield. 

- Take out tubes and leave on benchtop to thaw 
- Take a picture of the tubes to document buffer color and amount of tissue in each tube 
- Label 1.5 mL tubes w/ sample ID
- After sample is thawed, invert the tube 3x and transfer 300 μl into new 1.5 mL tube

### Prot-K digestion 

- Using the PK digestion buffer (stored in -20°C) from the kit, add 30 μL into each sample tube (1:10 ratio of PK Digestion Buffer:Sample)
- Add 15 μL of Proteinase K to each sample tube (1:2 ratio of Proteinase K:PK Digestion Buffer).
- Invert 3x to mix 
- Incubate on bench top at room temperature for 15 minutes 
- Put the original sample tubes back in the freezer to save as back ups

### Lysis & column transfer 

- While incubating samples, label 2 more 1.5 mL tubes for each sample and 1 DNA and 1 RNA spin down column for each sample 
	- Yellow column = DNA
	- Green column = RNA
- Turn on heating block to 70°C. 
- Fill a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with Tris-EDTA (use this solution as is) for DNA elution. You will need 100 μL for each sample, so aliquot 1 mL per 10 samples. Place this tube in the heating block so it will be at 70 ºC when you are ready to elute.
- Set up a waste beaker for liquid Zymo Kit waste. This will be disposed of in the waste disposal area in the collection container for Zymo Kit Liquid Waste next to the hood 
- After digestion, invert/flick to mix tubes and centrifuge at 9,000 rcf for 3 minutes to pellet. Spin tubes with hinges facing out so pellet will form along the wall with the hinge.
	- Note on centrifugation from ZD notebook [post](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/: Depending on the centrifuge settings, it will count down time from when you press start or from when it reaches the desired speed. Ours counts down when you press start, so we add 30s to each spin as written to account for the time to get up to speed. Here, I would spin for 3 mins, 30s.
- Set pipette to 400 μL and remove supernatant and transfer to new 1.5 mL tube. Do not disturb the pellet!
- Add 345 μL of DNA/RNA lysis buffer (1:1 ratio with supernatant volume)
	- Pipette up and down to mix 
- Transfer entire volume (~690 μL) to YELLOW DNA Spin-Away filter column. This will bind the DNA and everything that flows through will be RNA
- Centrifuge column at 15,000 rcf for 30 seconds and SAVE THE FLOW THROUGH from this spin
- Transfer the flow through volume to second (RNA labeled) 1.5 mL tube 

### DNA extractions

- Label final DNA 1.5 mL tube with full sample number, initials, extraction date, any other important info and "gDNA" on the side. The cap should have the sample number and "gDNA" written on it 
- Label PCR tubes (aka PCR strip tubes, they are smol) for a small sample aliquot for QC. Write sample number (or shortened version) and "DNA"
- Transfer yellow DNA column (with DNA bound to it) to new collection tube
- Add 400 μL of DNA/RNA Prep Buffer 
- Centrifuge at 15,000 rcf for 30 seconds and discard flow through in waste beaker
- Add 700 μL of DNA/RNA Prep Buffer 
- Centrifuge at 15,000 rcf for 30 seconds and discard flow through in waste beaker
- Repeat the two above steps: add 700 μL of DNA/RNA Prep Buffer, centrifuge at 15,000 rcf for 30 seconds and discard flow through in waste beaker 
- Dry filter by centrifuging at 15,000 rct for 2 minutes
- After spin, discard collection tube and transfer yellow DNA column to final, labeled DNA tube 
- Add 50 μL of warmed Tris buffer gently directly onto filter without touching filter (elution)
- Incubate for 5 mins at room temp
- Centrifuge at 15,000 rct for 30 seconds
- Repeat the 3 previous steps: add 50 μL of warm Tris buffer, incubate for 5 mins, and centrifuge at 15,000 rct for 30 seconds
	- Total volume of 100 μL of gDNA in final tube 
	- Discard the yellow column
- Aliquot 10 μL of DNA into labeled PCR tube for QC and keep on ice
- Place final DNA tube in labeled/designated freezer box in -20°C freezer 

### RNA extractions

- Label final RNA 1.5 mL tube with full sample number, initials, extraction date, any other important info and "RNA" on the side. The cap should have the sample number and "RNA" written on it 
- Label PCR tubes (aka PCR strip tubes, they are smol) for a small sample aliquot for QC. Write sample number (or shortened version) and "RNA"
- Add 700 μL of 100% ethanol (1:1 ratio) to the tube with RNA in it. The tube will now have ~1400 μL
- Mix by pipetting up and down
- Move 700 μL into the RNA filter column in a collection tube 
- Centrifuge at 15,000 rcf for one minute. Discard waste in beaker
- Transfer the rest of the mix (about 700 μL) to the RNA filter column. Centrifuge at 15,000 rcf for one minute. Discard waste in beaker
- Add 400 μL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to the filter column. Centrifuge at 15,000 rcf for one minute. Discard waste in beaker
- Make DNase I treatment master mix in new 1.5 mL tube. Gently mix. DO NOT vortex
	- 75 μL DNA digestion buffer per sample 
	- 5 μL DNase I per sample 
	- Example for 4 samples: 75 μL digestion buffer x 4 samples = 300 μL. 5 μL DNase x 4 samples = 20 μL. Total volume is 320 μL. 
- Add 80 μL of master mix directly onto each filter without touching the filter. 
- Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes
- Add 400 μL of DNA/RNA Prep Buffer to each sample. Centrifuge at 15,000 rcf for one minute. Discard waste in beaker
- Add 700 μL of DNA/RNA Wash Buffer to each sample. Centrifuge at 15,000 rcf for one minute. Discard waste in beaker. **Do this TWICE!!!!!**
- Dry filter by centrifuging at 15,000 rcf for two minutes
- Discard collection tube. Put column with the RNA into the final 1.5 mL labeled RNA tube
- Add 50 μL of RNAse/DNAse free water directly onto filter gently without touching the filter. Incubate for 2 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge at 15,000 rcf for one minute. **Do this TWICE!!!!!**
- Discard the green column. You will now have 100 μL of RNA in that tube. 
- Aliquot 10 μL of RNA into labeled PCR tube for QC and keep on ice
- Place final RNA tube in labeled/designated freezer box in -80°C freezer 

## Quality Control 

### Qubit 

Qubit assesses sample quantity. Protocol based on [Z. Dellaert](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/) & [M. Schedl](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)

- Special types of tubes are needed for Qubit. Calculate how many tubes needed
	- 2 tubes per sample (one for DNA, one for RNA) 
	- 4 tubes for standards (two standards for DNA, two standards for RNA)
	- Example for 4 samples: 4 samples x 2 tubes per sample + 4 tubes for standards = 12 tubes total needed
- Get out the Qubit specific tubes and label on the top ONLY
- Get out the standards from the 4°C fridge. They are in plastic bags in the fridge. The tops are labeled DNA S1, DNA S2, RNA S1 and RNA S2.
- Calculate the amount of master mix needed for samples. Each sample gets 200 μL total. 
	- Standards will get 190 μL of master mix (will later add 10 μL of standard) 
	- Samples will get 199 μL of master mix (will later add 1 μL of sample)
	- To calculate amount, add n (sample size) + 1 for error 
	- Multiply the number above by 199 to get the amount of liquid needed
	- Example for 4 samples: 12 (number of samples and standards) + 1 = 13. 13 samples x 199 μL per sample = 2587 μL. 
- Make the DNA and RNA master mix. These are in separate tubes (either 1.5 or 5 mL depending on how much will be made). 
	- The RNA mix will be blue, the DNA will be red 
- Add the master mix to the Quibit tubes. The standard tubes will get 190 μL and the sample tubes will get 199 μL. 
- Add 1 μL of sample (from smol PCR tubes) to the corresponding Qubit tube. 
- Add 10 μL of standard to the corresponding Qubit tube
- Spin all Qubit tubes for a few seconds and let the tubes sit for ~2 minutes. 
- Take all tubes to the Qubit. Choose the specific assay that the tubes will be read at (for DNA = dsDNA Broad Range; for RNA = RNA Broad Range)
- Read the 2 standards first and record these values. The standards should have a 10x difference between them. 
- Read all samples and record values. 
	- The settings should be 1 μL of sample and output as ng/μL
- Read all samples AGAIN and record values

Some of the samples didn't have any detectable DNA or RNA.

### Gel  

- Set up small gel box and insert tray with the rubber gaskets touching the long side of the box. Make sure gaskets are flush with the side of the box 
- Measure out 0.75g of agarose and add it to 1 L flask
- Add 50 mL of 1x TAE (from the "New" bottle)
- Microwave for 45 seconds. Remove with heat safe gloves and put on the bench. Let it cool until you can comfortably hold the flask
- Put combs in the gel tray. The combs are the 14-well 'thicker' ones. Put on the top of the tray and one in the middle
- Add 1 μL of gel green stain to the flask. Swirl to mix and pour into gel tray 
- Let the gel set for 30 minutes
- Once the gel has solidified, remove the two combs. 
- Pour 1x TAE (from the "Used" bottle) into the tray/box so that it is completely covered
- In the first well for each row, load 3 μL of the 1kb GeneRuler ladder as a reference. This is kept in the xxx fridge
- Add 1 μL of purple loading dye to each sample in the PCR strip tubes. Pipette up and down to mix 
- Set pipette to 10 μL and pull up entire sample. BE CAREFUL not to introduce any bubbles. Load each sample into the wells. Do for DNA and RNA samples. 
	- Make sure you remember which sample is in which well!
- Connect the lid (run to red) and plug it into the gel box machine. 
- Run the gel for 60 mins at 60 volts
- Once the gel is done running, take the gel out and put it on the gel imager box. Cover with orange filter and black box and take a picture of the gel 
- Pour 1x TAE into the "Used" bottle 
- Rinse tray and box with DI water

"Good" DNA will form a distinct band at the top of the gel. "Good" RNA will form 2 distinct bands at 18S and 28S locations about halfway down the lane

# SwitchFree library prep

This post details the info about the SwitchFree library prep. See Zymo's protocol [here](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_r3008_r3009__zymo_seq_switchfree_3_mrna_library_kit.pdf). 

I will be prepping samples from Flo's ENCORE priming experiment conducted in Bermuda 2024 (see github [repo](https://github.com/flofields/Coral_Priming_Experiments_Summer_2024) for more information on the experiment). Today, I am prepping 8 samples. 

The kit needs a minimum of 10 ng of total RNA or a maximum of 500 ng of total RNA, which is a large range. We will be using 12 ng of total RNA as input. Here's a breakdown of input RNA volumes for each sample:

| TubeID | Qubit RNA avg (ng/uL) | Strip tube # | RNA (uL) | Ultrapure water (uL) | Total starting volume (ul) | Primer |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------ |
| MD-4-21      | 15.2           | 1            | 1      | 4                | 5.0                        | 1      |
| MD-5-6      | 15.1           | 2           | 1      | 4                | 5.0                        | 2     |
| MD-2-23      | 10.15           | 3           | 1.2      | 3.8                 | 5.0                        | 7     |
| MD-2-8      | 13.6          | 4           | 1      | 4                 | 5.0                        | 58     |
| MD-1-4      | 13.7          | 5           | 1      | 4                 | 5.0                        | 85     |
| MD-5-20      | 4.79          | 6           | 2.5      | 2.5                 | 5.0                        | 86     |
| MD-5-3      | 43.5          | 7           | 1      | 4                 | 5.0                        | 87     |
| MD-1-7      | 27.6          | 8           | 1      | 4                 | 5.0                        | 88     |

### Materials 

- [Zymo-Seq SwitchFree 3' mRNA Library Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-switchfree-3-mrna-library-kit)
- PCR tubes 
- Thermocycler 
- Mini centrifuge
- Aluminum beads (to keep things on ice)
- Magnetic stand for PCR tubes 
- Kit contents

### Buffer preperation 

Once buffers are prepared for a kit, they do not need to be prepared again. 

- Add 300 uL of the Select-a-Size MagBead concentrate to 10 mL of Select-a-Size MagBead Buffer. 
	- These should be prepared at least 5 days ahead of library prep. 
- Add 24 mL of 100% ethanol to the DNA Wash Buffer concentrate. Store at room temperature. 

### Best practices 

- Avoid multiple freeze thaws of all components, and aliquot components as necessary
- Remove enzymes from cold storage just before use and return to cold storage immediately after use
- Thaw and maintain all components on ice unless noted otherwise 
- Flick to mix thawed components and briefly centrifuge prior to use 
- After adding each component, mix by pipetting up and down 15-20 times. Briefly centrifuge after 
- Pre-program thermal cycler with lid heating ON set to >100-105Â°C 
- Turn on thermocycler day-of to preheat 
- Pre-calculate how much to dilute RNA samples 

### Protocol 

Protocol was followed according to this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-03-29-Zymo-SwitchFree.md). 

Some modifications 

- Used 12 ng RNA input instead of 11 ng
- For the polyA R1 reagent, used 3uL of polyA R1 reagent + 2uL of DNase/RNase free water instead of 5 uL of polyA R1 reagent 
- Sections 1 and 3 were done on 6/30/25; Section 3 and QC were done on 7/1/25
- In Section 3, after the thermocycler library amplification, samples sat at 4C for ~45 mins while I had a brief meeting 

### QC

Run [DNA Tapestation](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-30-DNA-Tapestation.md) to visualize libraries. Here's an example of what the library should look like on a Tapestation:

I ran the tapestation on the libraries on 7/1/25. See the full report [here](XXXXX).

This post includes the full notebook for the July-August 2023 *Diploria labyrinthiformis* coral spawning and field expedition in Bermuda at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences. My project will focus on development of *D. labyrinthiformis* larvae through their use of energetic stores and expression of coding and non-coding transcripts. The ENCORE team (Dr. Hollie Putnam (URI), Dr. Gretchen Goodbody-Gringley (CCMI), Dr. Sam de Putron (BIOS), Dr. Yvonne Sawall (BIOS), Dr. Brett Jameson (BIOS), Dr. Chloe Carbonne (BIOS, Flo Fields (URI), and Hailey Davis (CCMI)) are also here doing a variety of experiments with *D. labyrinthiformis* and *Porites astreoides*. Githubs for the ENCORE projects are [here](https://github.com/ENCORE-Project). Github for the developmental timeseries is [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/Hawaii_Larval_TimeSeries/tree/main).

Arrived! Flo showed me around BIOS campus and the mesocosm area. We sized the PAST spat that are here from an earlier experiment. 

## 20230731

Mostly prep work. I unpacked the things I brought in the pelican cases and organized our supplies. I labeled tubes for my developmental time series. Because I'm hoping to link this time series to the one I did in Hawaii, I am keeping a similar labeling scheme: 

ADD LABELING SCHEME 

I also helped the ENCORE team with some Past work (i.e. cleaned, sized spat, made concrete for outplanting Past adults back on the reef). 

The ENCORE team had a meeting today where Hollie presented TPC data from last summer.

In the morning, I did more prep work for Dlab spawning and helped with sizing the Past spat. We also sampled the Past spat and adults for DNA/RNA. 

The ENCORE team had another meeting today where Brett reviewed the Past experimental design and steps moving forward. Then I presented about plans for Dlab spawning. The best paper on Dlab spawning in the Caribbean is [Chamberland et al. 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-016-1504-2). Important to note is that these colonies were monitored *in situ* and the experiment took place in Curaço. They found that egg-sperm bundles were typically released 10-13 days after the full moon, with peak release at 11-12 days after the full moon:

In this paper, release occurred 52 to 2 minutes before sunset. Bundles were also released in pulses. From the Chamberland et al. 2017 paper: “Typically,  one  section  of  the  colony  spawned  for 5 ± 5 min  (mean ± SD)  after  which  all  gamete  release stopped, then resumed after 3–20 min. This resulted in 1–3 spawning pulses per colony per day.” 

This is a figure that documents embryogenesis, larval development and settlement in the Chamberland paper.

They reported that bundles typically broke apart ~45 mins after release (b). 80 mins after release, fertilized eggs undergo their first cleavage (c). 30 mins later, another cleavage occurs (d). 180 mins later, embryos break up into smaller embryos that may be viable (e). 5 hours after spawning, embryos develop into prawn chips (f). 6 hours after spawning, the onset of gastrulation begins (g). 10 hours after spawning, embryos become oval shaped (h). 13 hours after spawning, motile planulae develop (i). Larvae settled ~14 hours after CCA is provided for settlement (j). By 1 month after spawning, ~45% of recruits had acquired symbionts. I was frustrated by this paper, in that it documented development up to 13 hours post spawning and then didn't document anything else until 4 days after spawning when they had settled. It seems that development happens rather rapidly (compared to other species like Mcap). 

The paper also looked at the behavior of the individuals over time.

They showed that 31-39 hours after spawning, most of the individuals were either swimming in the water column, swimming on the bottom or lying on the bottom. They didn't provide CCA until after 82 hours after spawning, but I suspect that the larvae could have settled much earlier. 

After this overview, I presented my experimental overview. Essentially, it is the same experimental design as my Mcap experiment in Hawaii this year. I plan to sample at 8 developmental stages (fertilized egg, cleavage, prawn chip, early gastrula, mid gastrula, late gastrula, planula, and swimming larvae) at 2 treatments (ambient and high temperatures). n=6 replicates per treatment per time point.  

The ENCORE team discussed further Dlab spawning plans. We came up with 2 tiers: 

- Tier 1
	- Sperm concentration calibration curve 
	- Eggs per bundle
	- Sperm per bundle 
	- Egg size 
	- Fertilization success at ambient and high temperature 
	- Fertilization within a colony 
	- Gamete timing 
	- My experiment :-)
- Tier 2
	- Squaricle cultures at high and ambient temperatures (n=8 replicate squaricals per treatment)

We also discussed when would be the best time to collect the adult Dlab colonies, as the weather doesn't look good for the next few days. We decided that we will try to go on Saturday morning (8/5).

Similar to yesterday, I did prep work for Dlab in the morning. I also started writing up protocols for Dlab spawning, which will be detailed in this document in the next few days. 

We had our last big ENCORE meeting today. We confirmed that we would collect 10 adult Dlab colonies on Saturday (8/5); they will be ~30 cm in diameter. Hollie (still in RI) is making the spawning booms/dresses that will be put around the coral colonies each potential spawning night. We also discussed what else we want to do with the Dlab larvae (if we get any). We decided to try and replicate the ENCORE Past experiment that recently happened over the last few weeks. For this experiment, we will expose Dlab larvae to ambient or high temperatures for the duration of their larval development. At the end of 36-48 hours, we will sample the larvae for the same metrics as they sampled 


We also reviewed procedures for data storage/management, communication channels, and other housekeeping things. 

## 20230803

Worked on protocols and made datasheets for the protocols for Dlab spawning. These will be added to this post shortly.

Cup match, no work!

## 20230805

We collected 10 Dlab adult coral colonies (30cm in diameter) from Bailey's Bay Flatt this morning. The colonies are looking really happy in the mesocosms!

Lots of DLAB prep today!
Hollie, Flo, Hailey and I did a lot of cleaning and organizing. Hailey and Flo moved the PAST spat to new mesocosms and set up the SMILE system in 4 of the smaller mesocosms. Hollie organized and cleaned the trailer. I prepped the different stations that we will need when the corals actually spawn. I also made 0.22 um filtered seawater today with this fancy vacuum pump (picture below). Very happy that we could find a vacuum pump or else I would have had to pump ~20 L of FSW by hand. 

Hollie and I were able to get access to a spectrophotometric plate reader and do an initial run on the plate reader to see how long it might take to run the sperm calibration curve. We set it so that it would read from 280-800 nm at 10 nm increments, but it stopped before it was finished for some reason. Instead, we set it so that it would read from 280-800 nm in 20 nm increments. This worked and took ~15 minutes. Hollie may need to run it in smaller "chunks" (i.e., run from 280-400 nm at 20 nm increments, 400-600 in 20 nm increments, etc), depending on how long things are taking. 

Around 1900, we started watching the corals for signs of setting. We didn't see any by 21:00, so we called it off for the night. This is not unexpected to me, as it's still pretty earlier after the full moon for spawning.

More Dlab spawning prep!

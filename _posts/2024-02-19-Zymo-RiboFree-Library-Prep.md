# RiboFree library prep test for Mcap developmental time series Hawaii 2023

This post details the info about the library prep steps for the *M. capitata* developmental time series experiment in Hawaii 2023. The github for that project is linked [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/Hawaii_Developmental_TimeSeries). I'm using the [Zymo-Seq RiboFree Total RNA Library Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-ribofree-total-rna-library-kit) for total RNA library prep (I got the 12 prep kit). See Zymo's protocol [here](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/r3000_zymo-seq_ribofree_total_rna_library_kit.pdf). 

I'll be using samples M60 and M72 for this test. They were extracted on [2/10/24](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-02-10-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae-DT.md) and had an average of 36.5 and 24.1 ng/ul of RNA, respectively. The kit needs a minimum input of 10 of total RNA or a maximum input of 250 ng of total RNA. I'm going to use 190 ng as my input concentration. When Maggie did this library prep with adult *M. capitata*, she used 195 ng of RNA as input for each sample (see her library prep post [here](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/zribo-lib-RNA-second/). She was working with similar RNA concentrations as me (see extraction post [here](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Holobiont-Integration-August-DNA-RNA-Extractions/), so I feel like it would be best to follow her input since she was able to produce libraries). 

I did the Ribofree library prep using these same samples on 2/15/24 (see post [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-01-12-Zymo-RiboFree-Library-Prep.md)). I was relatively happy with tapestation results, but the peaks on the graphs were more like hills (tapestation results at bottom of the [page](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-01-12-Zymo-RiboFree-Library-Prep.md)). After discussing with lab members and looking at Maggie's old Ribofree posts, I decided to increase the number of PCR amplification cycles from 11 to 15. 

Here's the RiboFree library prep workflow:

### Materials 

- [Zymo-Seq RiboFree library kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-ribofree-total-rna-library-kit)
- PCR tubes 
- Thermocycler 
- Heating block 
- Mini centrifuge
- Vortex 
- Aluminum beads (to keep things on ice)
- Magnetic stand for PCR tubes 
- 1.5 mL tubes 
- Kit contents

### Protocol 

Protocol was followed according to this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-01-12-Zymo-RiboFree-Library-Prep.md). The only difference is that the number of PCR library amplification cycles was changed to 15 from 11. For this prep, M60 and M72 used the primers 03 and 04, respectively. 

### QC 

Run [DNA Tapestation](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-30-DNA-Tapestation.md) for visualize libraries. Here's an example of what the library should look like on a Tapestation:

Here's how my samples turned out on 2/19/24.

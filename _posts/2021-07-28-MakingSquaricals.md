## GSO *Astrangia* Experiment: Making squaricals

**About**: This post outlines the steps for making squaricals. The squaricals will be used to hold larvae after spawning and fertilization. 

1. Drill a 1/2'' hole into the squarical between the 20 and 22 quart mark with a hole saw. 
2. Put a 1/2'' PVC coupler through the hole
Using hot glue and blue rubber tubing, seal the coupler with the hole. There should be no outlets or holes.

3. Cut 1/2'' PVC pipe into xx and xx inch pipes. Attach the longer pipe to the coupler end inside of the squarical, and attach the shorter pipe to the coupler end outside of the squaricals.

4. Cut xxx PVC pipe into xxx pieces, and drill a 1/2'' hole into the side of xxx PVC pipe. 
5. Put a 1/2'' PVC coupler through the hole
Using hot glue and blue rubber tubing, seal the coupler with the hole. There should be no outlets or holes.

6. Cut 1/2'' PVC pipe into xx inch pipe. Attach the pipe to the coupler end facing outside. Once attached, secure a 1/2'' PVC elbow to the end of the pipe. 

7. Measure and cut mesh for each banjo filter. Using hot glue, glue the mesh to the outside of the xxx PVC. Do this on both sides. You now have your banjo screens.

8. Attach the other end of the elbow on the banjo filter to the pipe inside of the squarical.

9. On the outside of the squarical, put a T PVC pipe connector on the end of the pipe. Cut 1/2'' PVC pipe into xx inch pipe. Attach this to the bottom part of the T for drainage.

11. Glue a ziptie on edge of squarical to hold incoming water tube.

Link to submission spreadsheet: 

When trying to add A, B, etc as sample name, it gives this error: 

```
Your table upload failed because multiple rows in the table (ignoring sample name, sample title and description fields) are identical. Each row must have at least one unique attribute value. Please enter information that distinguishes each sample, eg isolate names or different details of the sample collection. If the distinguishing information is in the sample name, title or description, please copy that value into the appropriate attribute, either one of the predefined attributes or a custom attribute you add.
```

Going to add `_Pacuta` at the end of the sample name.

After filling out values for attributes provided in the template, your samples are not distinguishable by at least one, or a combination of attributes.


!Make the combined value of all attributes unique for each sample while taking into account that "sample name", "sample title" and "description" are not included in this check for "uniqueness".

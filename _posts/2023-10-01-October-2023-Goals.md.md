### Writing and manuscripts 
              
1. Submit Astrangia review to Coral Reefs
2. Full draft of dissertation proposal
3. Write full methods and results for Astrangia 2021 experiment 
4. Continue outlining histology manuscript intro 

### Sample processing

1. RNA extractions for AH - HI 2023
2. Physiology processing for developmental time series 2023
	- Carbs
	- Lipids
	- Cell counts 
3. Initial cell counts for Astrangia 2021
	- Count 20 samples and see how variable they are after homogenizing 2x

### Data analysis 
1. E5 deep dive - lncRNA and miRNA
2. Astrangia mRNA analysis 

## Daily log 

### October 1
- Full review of dissertation proposal

### October 2
- Continued to refine proposal 
- Aquarium room work, received corals from HI 
- Read 2 papers 
- Writing meeting 
- Lab journal club 
- Worked on glmmSeq and DESeq2 code 

### October 3 
- Met w/ Hollie about proposal 
- Ran plate of carbs 
- Worked on DESeq analysis of Astrangia mRNA 

### October 4
- Got DESeq code to work by grouping treatment and timepoint into one 'group'. Still want to investigate if I can build a model with the design ~Treatment + Timepoint + Treatment:Timepoint 
- Tried to get bowtie to work on Andromeda, did not succeed 
- Ran orthofinder for e5 species (protein seqs) and did a orthogroup blast comparison for e5 deep dive
- Read papers on mechanisms of miRNAs responding to stress

### October 5
- Extracted 3 AH samples using elution volume of 65 uL
- Tapestation on 5 of AH samples that failed Qubit 
- Reviewed LZ and CG docs 
- Worked on IDP

October 2024 goals and daily notebook entries.

## Goals  

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. e5 ncRNA complete draft of manuscript 
2. Pacuta manuscript send to coauthors for edits 
3. AST results for manuscript 

### Sample processing

1. Send WGBS e5 deep dive samples 
2. Phys stuff for AST and Mcap DT

### Data analysis

1. Make fasta for 3'UTRs with gene names and rerun miranda 
2. Run mirtarrnaseq for AST and make figures for manuscript 
3. Run mirtarrnaseq for deep dive (Apul) - need count matrices for both miRNA and mRNA and miranda info 
4. Figure out trimming for miRNA data Mcap DT 2023 
5. Compiling all phys stuff for AST 2021 (if time)

### Field work / travel 

1. Resgister for sicb 
2. Book flights for sicb 
3. Confirm travel for cbass workshop

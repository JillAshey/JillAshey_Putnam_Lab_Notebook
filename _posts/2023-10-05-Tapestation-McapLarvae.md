I ran the Tapestation today based on Maggie's tapestation [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/). I ran 5 samples from AH's experiment that failed the Qubit. The samples that I ran were R43, R54, R59, R88, and R94. R43 was extracted on [10/5/23](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-10-05-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae.md.md), R59 & R94 were extracted on [9/11/23](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-09-11-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae.md), and R54 & R88 were extracted on [9/16/23](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-09-16-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae.md)

Amy and I ran the Tapestation together so the first 4 and last 1 samples on the gel are my samples. All the samples have distinct bands, just like on the gels that I ran:

I got pretty solid RIN values for all the samples! And the concentrations look good too. 

Here are the individual plots for the 4 samples:

All of these samples failed the Qubit, but got really good concentrations on the Tapestation. I still need to run a sample that passed Qubit on the Tapestation to compare.

# Extractions for Mcap developmental time series Hawaii 2023

This protocol is based on Maggie’s coral egg/larvae extraction [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/) and Kevin’s coral larvae extraction [protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Extractions-on-P.-astreoides-larvae-BEAD-BEATING/). This post details the info about the extraction steps for the *M. capitata* developmental time series experiment in Hawaii 2023. The github for that project is linked [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/Hawaii_Developmental_TimeSeries). 

### Samples 

I am only extracting RNA for these samples!

The samples extracted today were ones that I have previously extracted and sequenced. However, the smRNA sequencing failed for almost all of the samples, but Steven has offered to pay to resequenced them!! Very kind. I am re-extracting the RNA for the smRNA sequencing so that the facility can get fresh RNA that hasn't been thawed/frozen several times I used 300uL as my input volume instead of 500uL. These samples had already been bead beaten from previous extractions. 

Forgot to take sample picture :'(


### Materials 

- Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit [HERE](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) Protocol Booklet
- Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1X buffer for DNA elution
- Heating block capable of heating to 70ºC
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Plastics 
	- 3 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample
	- 1 PCR tubes per sample
	- 1 Qubit tubes per sample 

### Protocol

Protocol was followed according to this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-07-21-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae.md). A few differences: 

- In the RNA extraction, I added another wash step with 400 uL of wash buffer after the DNase incubation (i.e., after the incubation, I did 400 uL of prep buffer, 700 uL of wash buffer, 400 uL of wash buffer, and another 400 uL of wash buffer).
- I eluted in 80 uL of DNA/RNA free water (RNA) instead of 100 uL. 

### QC 

#### Qubit results 

Used RNA BR Qubit kit.

No RNA detected in M72 using the BR kit, may use the HS kit.

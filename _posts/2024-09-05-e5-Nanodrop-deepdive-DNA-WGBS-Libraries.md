# Nanodropping e5 deep dive DNA samples and WGBS libraries 

I have been trying to create WGBS libraries with the [Zymo Pico Methyl Seq kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/pico-methyl-seq-library-prep-kit) for 15 e5 deep dive samples. I successfully prepped 9 samples but 6 samples (3 POC and 3 POR) are still failing despite several iterations. 

- [20240613](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-06-13-Zymo-Pico-Methyl-Seq-Library-Prep.md) prep - used 25 ng of input DNA, 9 library amp cycles, 9 index amp cycles. 9 samples successfully prepped; 6 samples did not (3 POR, 3 POC). 
- [20240807](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-08-07-Zymo-Pico-Methyl-Seq-Library-Prep.md) prep - tried to redo the 6 samples that failed. Used 25 ng of input DNA, 9 library amp cycles, 9 index amp cycles. New polymerase was used. All samples failed 
- [20240828](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-08-28-Zymo-Pico-Methyl-Seq-Library-Prep.md) prep - tried to redo the 6 samples that failed. Used 25 ng of input DNA for POC and 10 ng input DNA for POR. 12 library amp cycles for POC, 9 library amp cycles for POR, 9 index amp cycles. All samples failed 

I nanodropped the genomic DNA and all libraries on 9/5/24. See [here](https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/CAD/Product-Bulletins/TN52646-E-0215M-NucleicAcid.pdf) for an explanation regarding nanodrop output and expectations. 

Here are the results broken down by species. 

#### Acropora pulchra

All Acropora samples successfully prepped on the first try hooray!

#### Porites evermanni

471 and 491 were successful on the first try. 421, 487 and 489 have not been successful. The Nanodrop quality of the genomic DNA for all samples is pretty bad but 2 sampeles did successfully prep. Library quality is also pretty low.

#### Pocillopora tuahiniensis

403 and 417 were successful on the first try. 385, 393 and 401 have not been successful. The Nanodrop quality of the genomic DNA for all samples is decent so I am surprised that three of the libraries are not amplifying. I may just need to increase the number of amp and index cycles, as I have gotten a little bit of amplification from the POC samples but not enough for sequencing.

For all samples/species, quality of genomic DNA is higher than library quality, which makes sense to me since the library prep process probably degrades the nucleic acid in some ways.

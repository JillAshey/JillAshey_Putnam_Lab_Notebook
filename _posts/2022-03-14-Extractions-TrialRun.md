## Goal: go over MagBead protocol for 3 GSO Astrangia samples. 

Hollie and I went through the Zymo MagBead extraction protocol together. We wanted to assess the kit and figure out best practices before doing extractions for all my samples. The samples used today were from my 2021 Astrangia experiment at GSO. 

Samples used: AST-1630, AST-1754, AST-2007

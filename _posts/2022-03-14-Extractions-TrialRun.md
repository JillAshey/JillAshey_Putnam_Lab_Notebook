## Goal: go over MagBead extraction protocol for 3 GSO Astrangia samples. 

[Zymo MagBead kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymobiomics-magbead-dna-rna)

Hollie and I went through the Zymo MagBead extraction protocol together on 20220314. We wanted to assess the kit and figure out best practices before doing extractions for all my samples. This kit was chosen because it includes purification of small/microRNAs and I could (hopefully) process my samples on a 96-well plate, which would speed up the process exponentially. 

The samples used today were from my 2021 Astrangia experiment at GSO. Sample IDs: AST-1630, AST-1754, AST-2007

### Protocol prep

#### Reagents and supplies 

#### Equipment 

### Homogenization 

1. If corals have already been clipped and are currently in 2 mL bead tubes w/ DNA/RNA Shield, go to next step. 
2. If corals have not been clipped, follow protocol [here](xx). 
3. 

When beginning extractions, clipped samples should be in 2 mL bead tubes with DNA/RNA shield.

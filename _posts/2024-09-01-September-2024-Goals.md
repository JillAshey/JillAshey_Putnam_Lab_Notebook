September 2024 goals and daily notebook entries.

## Goals  

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. Dissertation proposal submission to grad school
2. IDP + plan outline
3. Post doc fellowship apps 
4. e5 ncRNA complete draft  
5. Pacuta manuscript submission 

### Sample processing

1. Re-amp 6 WGBS e5 deep dive samples
2. Phys stuff for AST and Mcap DT 
3. Find and send DNA for e5 samples 
4. Metabolomics test samples for e5 time series 

### Data analysis

1. 3'UTR for AST 2021 (GENE EXT) and rerun miRanda with that info 
2. Apul methylation w/ pacbio tools 
3. Compiling all phys stuff for AST 2021 

### Field work / travel 

1. Figure out travel for cbass workshop 
2. Apply for travel $$$ for cbass workshop 
3. Apply for travel $$$ for sicb

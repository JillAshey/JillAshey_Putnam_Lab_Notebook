## Goal: Make detailed protocol for larval respirometry with SDR at HIMB 2022

The lab already has an SDR [post](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/Equipment_Protocols/Respirometry_Protocol/SDR-Respirometry-Protocol.md), but I'm going to make one for my HIMB experiments. 

### Larval respirometry

#### Equipment/materials
- incubators 
- PreSens SDR SensorDish® Reader Basic Set 
- PreSens OxoDish® OD24 for oxygen measurements
- LoligoⓇ MicroResp™ Software 
- Circular Coverslips (> 48)
- Windows Computer
- Digital Traceable Thermometer
- AI lights
- Apogee Quantum Light Meter
- Hobo temperature loggers
- P1000 + tips
- Kimwipes
- Zip-ties

More information on equipment and materials can be found in the Putnam lab SDR [post](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/Equipment_Protocols/Respirometry_Protocol/SDR-Respirometry-Protocol.md).

#### Incubator set-up

- Drill a 1" hole into the right side of the incubator
- Put incubator trays at the bottom level
- Zip-tie an AI light inside the incubator at the top. The AI light power cord should run out of the hole in the incubator
- Place a Hobo temperature logger on the floor of the incubator for temperature measurements

#### Light set-up

- Plug the AI light in

add light setup info

#### SDR set-up 

The Putnam lab SDRs are in a small black case. Be careful with them, they are delicate! In the black case, there will be materials for two SDRs - will be labeled SDR1 or SDR2. Both SDR1 and SDR2 will have the same materials!!! Moving forward in this protocol, I'll only refer to SDR2 for clarity (but SDR1 is the exact same set-up). 

- Unbox the SDRs and separate materials into SDR1 and SDR2
- For each SDR set, you should have:
	- presens power box
	- SDR connector box 
	- electric plate 
	- glass plate 
	- plate cap
	- connector that will be from SDR connector box to electric plate 
	- connector that will be from presens box to connector box
	- USB connector from connector box to PC laptop 
- the connector has 3 ports: one for SDR electric plate, one for PC, and one for presens box. plug the wires into their respective ports
- With the SDR plate wire, put the other end through the hole on the right side of the incubator 
- before putting SDR plate in the incubator, cap one end of it with the plate cap
- Put the SDR plate in the incubator and connect it with the SDR connector wire. note the orientation of the plate 
- carefully put the plate in the incubator

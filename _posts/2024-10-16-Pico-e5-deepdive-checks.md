# Pico Methy-Seq Library Prep checks for E5 samples

I have been doing the pico prep for 15 e5 deep dive samples and I want to sum up all the information here, as I have had to redo 6 samples. 

### Prep dates 

- [6/13/24](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-06-13-Zymo-Pico-Methyl-Seq-Library-Prep.md)
	- Input amount: 25 ng for all species 
	- Number of PCR cycles (Section 4): 9 
	- Successful libraries: 403 (POC), 413 (ACR), 417(POC), 423 (ACR), 427 (ACR), 439 (ACR), 467 (ACR), 471 (POR), 491 (POR)
	- Failed libraries: 385 (POC), 393 (POC), 401 (POC), 421 (POR), 487 (POR), 489 (POR)
	- [Tapestation results](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/tapestation/DNA_Pico-2024-06-13.pdf)
	
- [8/7/24](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-08-07-Zymo-Pico-Methyl-Seq-Library-Prep.md)
	- Input amount: 25 ng for all species 
	- Number of PCR cycles (Section 4): 9 
	- Modifications: new PrepAmp polymerase 
	- Successful libraries: none
	- Failed libraries: 385 (POC), 393 (POC), 401 (POC), 421 (POR), 487 (POR), 489 (POR)
	- [Tapestation results](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/tapestation/DNA_Pico-2024-08-07.pdf)

- [8/28/24](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-08-28-Zymo-Pico-Methyl-Seq-Library-Prep.md)
	- Input amount: 25 ng for POC, 10 ng for POR
	- Number of PCR cycles (Section 4): 12 for POC, 9 for POR
	- Modifications: Different input amount for POR, changed number of cycles for POC
	- Successful libraries: none
	- Failed libraries: 385 (POC), 393 (POC), 401 (POC), 421 (POR), 487 (POR), 489 (POR)

- [10/15/24](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-10-15-Zymo-Pico-Methyl-Seq-Library-Prep.md)
	- Input amount: 50-60 ng for POC, 2-20 ng for POR
	- Number of PCR cycles (Section 4): 15 for POC, 9 for POR
	- Modifications: Different input amount for both species, changed number of cycles for POC. For POR, used extractions done by myself (on 9/25/24) and Kristina (in 2021)
	- Successful libraries: none
	- Failed libraries: 385 (POC), 393 (POC), 401 (POC), 421 (POR), 487 (POR), 489 (POR)

February 2025 goals and daily notebook entries.

## Goals  

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. e5 ncRNA complete draft of manuscript submit to biorxiv (chapter 1)
2. Astrangia 2021 results and discussion (chapter 2)
	- Linking miRNA mRNA regulation and pathways 
	- Discussing positive and negative miRNA correlations 
3. Complete my section CBASS results + discussion

### Sample processing

1. Switchfree library prep for Mcap 2023 samples 
2. Protein assay for 96 lipid/metabolite e5 samples 

### Data analysis

1. e5 deep dive expression 
	- Name updated miRNAs for 3 species 
	- Summarize number of targets of each miRNA, positive/negative correlations, etc
	- Compare/contrast miRNA function with previous lit
2. Astrangia 2021 continue analysis for miRNA mRNA interactions (chapter 2)
	- Pathways of interest for discussion 
	- Plot number of binding sites by energy score - done 2/2/25
	- Spearman rank correlation in addition to Pearson's (Zhang et al. 2018)
3. Mcap miRNA trimming and identification (chapter 3) 
4. DE analysis for Mcap miRNA and mRNA data (chapter 3)
5. CBASS plots and tables 
	- Make nice figures for paper 
	- Make stats supplementary tables 

### Field work / travel 

1. Fill out TERs (CBASS and sicb)

## How did I do on my goals this month?  

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. e5 ncRNA complete draft of manuscript submit to biorxiv (chapter 1) - no, on Hollie's desk
2. Astrangia 2021 results and discussion (chapter 2)
	- Linking miRNA mRNA regulation and pathways - yes
	- Discussing positive and negative miRNA correlations - yes 
3. Complete my section CBASS results + discussion - sort of? Need to rerun some stats after Lucia reruns ED50 code

### Sample processing

1. Switchfree library prep for Mcap 2023 samples - yes, need to send 
2. Protein assay for 96 lipid/metabolite e5 samples - no, still need to do 

### Data analysis

1. e5 deep dive expression 
	- Name updated miRNAs for 3 species - yes
	- Summarize number of targets of each miRNA, positive/negative correlations, etc - yes for miranda
	- Compare/contrast miRNA function with previous lit - no
2. Astrangia 2021 continue analysis for miRNA mRNA interactions (chapter 2)
	- Pathways of interest for discussion - yes
	- Plot number of binding sites by energy score - done 2/2/25
3. Mcap miRNA trimming and identification (chapter 3) - sort of?
4. DE analysis for Mcap miRNA and mRNA data (chapter 3) - no
5. CBASS plots and tables - no, on hold until data is rerun
	- Make nice figures for paper 
	- Make stats supplementary tables 

### Field work / travel 

1. Fill out TERs (CBASS and sicb) - yes, TERs in URI system now

Overall a good month. I also set the date of my defense as April 9!! So the next two months will be heavily focused on this.

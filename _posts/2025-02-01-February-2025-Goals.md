February 2025 goals and daily notebook entries.

## Goals  

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. e5 ncRNA complete draft of manuscript submit to biorxiv (chapter 1)
2. Astrangia 2021 results and discussion (chapter 2)
	- Linking miRNA mRNA regulation and pathways 
	- Discussing positive and negative miRNA correlations 
3. Complete my section CBASS results + discussion

### Sample processing

1. Switchfree library prep for Mcap 2023 samples 
2. Protein assay for 96 lipid/metabolite e5 samples 

### Data analysis

1. e5 deep dive expression 
	- Name updated miRNAs for 3 species 
	- Summarize number of targets of each miRNA, positive/negative correlations, etc
	- Compare/contrast miRNA function with previous lit
2. Astrangia 2021 continue analysis for miRNA mRNA interactions (chapter 2)
	- Pathways of interest for discussion 
	- Plot number of binding sites by energy score 
	- Spearman rank correlation in addition to Pearson's (Zhang et al. 2018)
3. Mcap miRNA trimming and identification (chapter 2) 
4. DE analysis for Mcap miRNA and mRNA data (chapter 2)
5. CBASS plots and tables 
	- Make nice figures for paper 
	- Make stats supplementary tables 

### Field work / travel 

1. Fill out TERs (CBASS and sicb)

## Daily log 

### 20250201

- Switchfree library prep w/ Mcap 2023 samples 



To do code-wise for AST 2021: 

- BH correction for PCC pvalues 
- Spearman's correlation calculation
- 






Notes: 

GSA for maldives 
ask Hollie for cfs for maldives 
sicb put difference on intern 
uber:8.10+10.19+7.29+8.48+10.21+8.95

polyA for Mcap 
tapestation and qubit for every sample -- 32 samples for me, #1-32, ask what concentrations to pool at -- will be prepared to pool at specific molarity

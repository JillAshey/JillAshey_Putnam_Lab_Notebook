# miRNA library prep for Mcap developmental time series Hawaii 2023

This post details the info about the miRNA library prep steps for the *M. capitata* developmental time series experiment in Hawaii 2023. The github for that project is linked [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/Hawaii_Developmental_TimeSeries). I'm using the [Zymo-Seq miRNA library kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-mirna-library-kit) for small RNA library prep (I got the 12 prep kit). See Zymo's protocol [here](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/r3006_r3007-zymo-seq_mirna_library_kit.pdf). 

I'll be using samples





 M9, M13, M23, M35, M52 and M85. M9 was extracted on [2/22/24](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-02-22-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae-DT.md), and all of the other samples were extracted on [2/10/24](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-02-10-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae-DT.md). These samples, along with M60 and M72 (prepped on [3/4/24](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-03-04-Zymo-miRNA-Library-Prep.md)), will be sent for sequencing. The samples represent n=1 from each time point during *M. capitata* development. I will use 150-200 ng of RNA from each sample. 

Here's the miRNA library prep workflow:

### Materials 

- [Zymo-Seq miRNA library kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-mirna-library-kit)
- PCR tubes 
- Thermocycler 
- Heating block 
- Mini centrifuge
- Bench top centrifuge  
- Aluminum beads (to keep things on ice)
- Magnetic stand for PCR tubes 
- Kit contents

### Materials 

Protocol was followed according to this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-01-09-Zymo-miRNA-Library-Prep.md). A few differences (and errors): 

- I changed the input RNA amount to ~150-200 ng
- I increased the number of amplification cycles from 16 to 22
- I did Section 1 on 6/3/24, then stored overnight at -20Â°C. On 6/4/24, I did Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5. 

### QC 

Run [DNA Tapestation](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-30-DNA-Tapestation.md) for visualize libraries. Here's an example of what the library should look like on a Tapestation:

Here's how my samples turned out on 






3/7/24. See full report [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/tapestation/DNA_ZymomiRNA_2024-03-07.pdf).

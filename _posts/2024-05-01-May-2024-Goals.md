2. Write physiological results for Astrangia 2021 experiment 
3. Resubmit Astrangia review manuscript 
4. Begin results for e5 ncRNA paper 

### Sample processing

1. Extractions + ribofree library prep for 24 Mcap DT 2023 samples 
2. Library prep for WGBS (27 samples)
3. Carbs for DT samples 
4. Phys (carb, protein, etc) for any remaining AST 2021 samples 

### Data analysis

1. Finish stats + plots for AST 2021 phys data 
2. WCGNAs with mRNA, miRNA and lnRNAs 


1. Finish stats for Astrangia 2021 phys data (carbs)
2. Complete Astrangia 2021 mRNA functional enrichment analysis 
3. Run miranda with genes of interest, invoking strict seed binding
4. Assemble mito genome for Apul 
5. Assemble coral genome for Apul 
6. Run miranda with lncRNAs 
7. Run DEG analysis with lncRNAs

## May reflection 

How did I do with my goals for this month? 

### Writing and manuscripts 
              
1. Full draft of dissertation proposal - yes, sent to Hollie for edits 
2. Write physiological results for Astrangia 2021 experiment - nope 
3. Resubmit Astrangia review manuscript - no. Need to wrote the Bio letters response to editor and make some edits to the review itself based on Temperate coral conference 
4. Begin results for e5 ncRNA paper - yes! Starting to write the miRNA results + make figures 

### Sample processing

1. Extractions + ribofree library prep for 24 Mcap DT 2023 samples - yes
2. Library prep for WGBS (27 samples) - no
3. Carbs for DT samples - no, maybe train undergrads ? 
4. Phys (carb, protein, etc) for any remaining AST 2021 samples - no, still need to look through master sample list 

### Data analysis

1. Finish stats + plots for AST 2021 phys data - yes for the most part. Need to discuss w/ Hollie about how to incorporate site maybe as a random variable
2. WCGNAs with mRNA, miRNA and lnRNAs - 
3. Finish stats for Astrangia 2021 phys data (carbs) - yes for the most part. Need to make sure all samples are processed
4. Complete Astrangia 2021 mRNA functional enrichment analysis - yes
5. Run miranda with genes of interest, invoking strict seed binding - yes
6. Assemble mito genome for Apul - no, working on installing mitohifi 
7. Assemble coral genome for Apul - have the code for it but still need to remove mito reads. Once I assemble the mito genome, I will purge the mito sequences and assemble the genome
8. Run miranda with lncRNAs - yes
9. Run DEG analysis with lncRNAs - yes

Pretty good month! I got a lot of data analysis done (motivated by the temperate coral conference).

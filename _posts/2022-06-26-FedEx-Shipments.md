## Goal: Outline how to ship packages for the Putnam lab via FedEx

Shipping via Fedex 

I'm shipping corals (*Montipora capitata*) to URI from Hawaii. This [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-08-27-CoralShipping.md) details how I will ship the corals. This post gives information on how to ship via Fedex for the Putnam lab.

If you want to ship a package from URI: 

1. Package the items into a secure container. Seal the container, making sure all the necessary information is inside the package. 
2. Log in to [FedEx](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/home.html). URI has a shipping deal with them so we pay a special URI rate. You will be logged in as Denise Brown. Ask Hollie or Denise for the username and password for the account.
3. At the top of the page, click Shipping. Then click Create a Shipment
4. This will take you to a page to create a shipment. Fill in the following information: 
	- 1) enter From information (name, address, phone number)
	- 2) enter To information (name, address, phone number)
	- 3) Specify the ship date, number of packages, weight of packages, service type, package type and dimensions. 
	- 4) Under Billing Details, bill transportation should automatically be UNIT3BIO-820. Do not change this unless specified to. Under 'Your reference', put Hollie's name so Denise knows who to bill.
		- There are other optional steps here. 
		- Under Pickup/Dropoff, select whether you will be dropping off the package at a Fedex location or scheduling a pickup. If scheduling a pickup, select the date and time span that you would like the package to be picked up. **IMPORTANT**: if you schedule a pickup at URI, you MUST take the package down to the loading dock and put it on/near the shelving unit by the large garage type door. If you do not, your package will not be picked up!!!!!
		- Under shipment notifications, enter your email and/or phone number to get shipping updates. If Hollie or someone else wants this information, you can add their emails. 
		- Under Rate and Transit Times, you can click calculate rate to see your rate for the package(s). 
	- 5) Under Complete your Shipment, click Ship in the bottom right hand corner. 
10. A shipping label will be generated. Confirm all information on the label is correct. Print the shipping label and tape it to the package using clear packing tape.
	- Make a note of the tracking number so you can track the package
11. Put the package at the scheduled pick up spot or drop it off at a FedEx store. Tell Hollie and the package recipient that the package has shipped and include the tracking number.

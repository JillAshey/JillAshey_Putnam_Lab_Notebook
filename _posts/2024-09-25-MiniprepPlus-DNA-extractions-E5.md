# Extractions for e5 time series 

This protocol is based on the Putnam lab Zymo Miniprep protocol (see example from Zoe [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)). This post details the info about the extraction steps for samples from the e5 timeseries (Acropora, Pocillopora, Porites spp.) in Moorea 2020. The e5 github is linked [here](https://github.com/urol-e5). 

### Samples 

The samples run today were re-extractions from the e5 deep dive and timeseries samples. I am having library prep issues with 6 of the deep dive samples and ~29 of the timeseries DNA samples do not have enough ng of DNA for Azenta. I am going to re-extract to see if we can get higher concentrations. Since the samples had already been through one extraction, there was <1mL of DNA/RNA shield in the tube.

There were 35 samples total, so I split them into two batches because the centrifuge can only fit 24 tubes at a time. 213, 385, 393, 401, and 521 were POC, the rest of the samples were POR. 

This photo is before I removed shield from the sample tubes:

### Materials 

ONLY DID DNA EXTRACTIONS

- Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit [HERE](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) Protocol Booklet
- Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1X buffer for DNA elution
- Heating block capable of heating to 70ÂºC
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Plastics 
	- 3 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample
	- 1 PCR tubes per sample
	- 1 Qubit tubes per sample 

### Protocol 

This [protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/) was followed. A few differences 

- For POC samples, 300 uL of sample was moved from the original shield tube into a new 1.5mL tube for the prot-k digestion step. 
- For POR samples, 100 uL of sample and 200 uL of fresh DNA/RNA shield was moved into a new 1.5mL tube for the prot-k digestion step. 
- Samples were eluted in 90 uL of Tris instead of 100 uL. 

### QC 

#### Qubit results 

For Qubit, I used the DNA HS kit on most samples; on 385, 393, and 401, I used the DNA BR kit because these were out of range with the HS kit. I used 5 uL of DNA as input for the HS kit and 2 uL of DNA as input for the BR kit.

The POC all look pretty good, but POR is still very low. The highest DNA ng POR value is 152. 

#### Gel 

I ran a 1.5% gel at 100 volts for 1 hour. Samples are in the same order as the Qubit. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/refs/heads/master/images/gel_20240926.jpg)

Gel looks terrible, can't see anything. There are some faint bands for 385, 393, and 401 (all POC). No bands for POR.

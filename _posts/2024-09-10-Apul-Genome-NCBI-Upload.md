Submitting single genome 

Genome submission: SUB14718394

General info 

- no bioproject or biosamples 
- genome coverage - The estimated base coverage across the genome, eg 12x. This can be calculated by dividing the number of bases sequenced by the expected genome size and multiplying that by the percentage of bases that were placed in the final assembly. More simply it is the number of bases sequenced divided by the expected genome size. 100x

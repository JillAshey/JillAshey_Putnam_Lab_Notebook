## Using Obsidian and Paperpile to take notes 

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a knowledge base and note-taking software application that operates on Markdown files. It allows users to make internal links for notes and then to visualize the connections as a graph. It is designed to help users organize and structure their thoughts and knowledge in a flexible, non-linear way. [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com) is a web-based commercial reference management software, with special emphasis on integration with Google Docs and Google Scholar.  

These two softwares can be used in conjunction with one another to keep track of papers, notes, pdfs, etc!

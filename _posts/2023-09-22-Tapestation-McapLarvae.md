I ran the Tapestation today based on Maggie's tapestation [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/). I ran 4 samples from AH's experiment that failed the Qubit. The samples that I ran were R17, R48, R98, and R107. R17 and R107 was extracted on [9/11/23](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-09-11-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae.md) and R48 and R98 was extracted on [9/16/23](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-09-16-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae.md). 

Amy and I ran the Tapestation together so the last 4 samples on the gel are my samples. All the samples have distinct bands, just like on the gels that I ran:

I didn't get RIN values for 3 out of the 4 samples, but that's okay because I got concentration values for all of them! 

Here are the individual plots for the 4 samples:

Here's a table comparison of the concentrations of the samples on the Qubit, Nanodrop and Tapestation: 

| Sample | Qubit concentration | Nanodrop concentration | TS concentration |
| ------ | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| R17    | NA                  | 10.5                   | 11.7             |
| R48    | NA                  | 7.2                    | 9.7              |
| R98    | NA                  | 14.8                   | 9.79             |
| R107   | NA                  | 6.3                    | 8.13             |

The Tapestation concentrations are higher than the Nanodrop with the exception of R98.

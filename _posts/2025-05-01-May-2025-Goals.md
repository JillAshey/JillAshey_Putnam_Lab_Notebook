May 2025 goals and daily notebook entries.

## Goals  

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. Dissertation edits - check w Hollie
	- For AST chapter, shorten discussion to focus on nutrient implications for miRNA discussion 
2. AST manuscript writing - polishing for publication, maybe submit to JEB? 
3. Mcap 2023 manuscript writing - methods and results 

### Sample processing

1. Train Flo re molecular work
2. e5 lipid/metabolite protein assays 
3. Anything else lab needs 

### Data analysis

1. AST 2021
	- phys univariate statistics. Remove Feb to see if this impacts stats at all
	- DESeq2 + GO enrichment for ambient Feb, June, and August to tell seasonal story of gene expression.
	- Exclude Feb time point and only include molecular for June + August amb and heat and run PERMANOVA. This will tell us if we care about treatment, time, or the interaction at all when looking at summer time points.
	- Do DESeq2 + GO enrichment for June + August amb and heat (exclude Feb)
	- mRNA-miRNA interactions - predicting interactions with miranda and correlations. network changes between june and aug amb v heat. short term network changes between june and august and long term network changes between feb, june, aug --> see how we can compare these statistically. look at papers that have done this stuff before and look at their stats
2. Mcap 2023 
	- clarification of polyadenlation - polyA v ribofree MZT and ZGA
	- subsetting genes of interest in Ayers et al. 2023
	- look at polyAD and polyA in relation to miRNAs
	- Process miRNA data once its back from Azenta 
3. e5 deep dive - check w Kathleen 
4. e5 molecular mechanisms - check w Kathleen 


### Field work / travel 

1. Help Zoe with her experiment 
2. Epimar?

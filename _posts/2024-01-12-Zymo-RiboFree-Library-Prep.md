# RiboFree library prep for Mcap developmental time series Hawaii 2023

This post details the info about the library prep steps for the *M. capitata* developmental time series experiment in Hawaii 2023. The github for that project is linked [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/Hawaii_Developmental_TimeSeries).  

I'm using the [Zymo-Seq RiboFree Total RNA Library Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-ribofree-total-rna-library-kit) for total RNA library prep (I got the 12 prep kit). Because there are only 12 preps in the kit, I want to stretch it to see if I can get more preps from the kit. **Therefore, in my protocol, I will be halving the volumes for each step, including the input.** See Zymo's protocol [here](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/r3000_zymo-seq_ribofree_total_rna_library_kit.pdf). 

The kit needs a minimum input of 10 of total RNA or a maximum input of 250 ng of total RNA. 

Here's the RiboFree library prep workflow:

NEED TO LOOK MORE INTO THIS TO ENSURE THAT I AM NOT DUPLICATING ON SAMPLES. May need to sequence on different lanes 

- Add 17.5 of Zymo Taq Premix to each sample 
- Pipette to mix and briefly centrifuge 
- Place samples in pre-heated thermocycler and run the Index PCR Program 

NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY CYCLES 

- Remove samples from thermocycler and place on ice

**Safe stopping point: samples can be stored at < -20°C overnight**

#### Section 5: Library Purification 

NEED TO FIGURE OUT IF I SHOULD HALVE THESE VOLUMES AS WELL PRIOR TO FINAL ELUTION

- Add 300 uL of Select-a-Size Magbead Concentrate to 10 mL Select-a-Size Magbead Buffer for first time usage 
- Allow Select-a-Size Magbeads to equilibrate to room temperature for at least 30 mins prior to use 
- Add 24 mL of 100% EtOH to the DNA Wash Buffer Concentrate for first time usage 
- Just before use, vortex Select-a-Size Magbeads until homogenous 
- Add 62.5 uL of Select-a-Size Magbeads to each sample 
- Pipette to mix until homogenous 
- Incubate for 5 mins at room temperature 
- Place the samples on a magnetic stand until the beads have fully separated from the solution, leaving the solution clear 
- Without disturbing the beads, remove and discard the cleared supernatent 
- Leave the samples on the magnetic stand
- Add 100 uL of DNA Wash Buffer to each sample
- Without disturbing the beads, remove and discard the supernatent
- REPEAT this step for a total of 2 washes 
- Keep the samples on the magnetic stand with the tube caps open to air dry the beads 
- After 1 min, remove any residual DNA Wash Buffer 
- Air dry until the bead pellet is no longer glossy (5-10 mins)
	- The time will depend on the humidity and temperature in the room. Optimally dried beads appear matte without cracking 
	- Start with 3 mins of air-dry time and increase the time as needed 
- Remove samples from magnetic stand and resuspend beads with 12.5 uL of DNase/RNase-Free Water. Pipette to mix 
	- 12.5 uL is NOT halved. Need to decide if I should halve it 
- Put the samples on the magnetic stand for 3 mins or until the solution is clear 
- Move 10 uL of the eluate to a new tube, avoiding bead carryover 
- This is the final miRNA library!!!!! Store at < -20°C

#### Library Validation and Quantification 

Libraries can be visualized using a gel or Tapestation and quantified using Qubit or Tapestation.

# SwitchFree library prep test

This post details the info about the SwitchFree library prep. See Zymo's protocol [here](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_r3008_r3009__zymo_seq_switchfree_3_mrna_library_kit.pdf). 

I will be prepping my 32 Mcap DT 2023 samples (see project github [repo](https://github.com/JillAshey/DevelopmentalTimeseries) for more information about the experiment); today, I am prepping 13 samples. I already sequenced these using rRNA depletion and smRNA sequencing but we are going to do polyA sequencing as well to better elucidate the MZT. The kit needs a minimum of 10 ng of total RNA or a maximum of 500 ng of total RNA, which is a large range. In my Ribofree and miRNA preps with the same samples, I used 190 and 100 ng per sample, respectively. I am going to use 100ng as input for this library prep.

### Buffer preperation 

Once buffers are prepared for a kit, they do not need to be prepared again. 

- Add 300 uL of the Select-a-Size MagBead concentrate to 10 mL of Select-a-Size MagBead Buffer. 
	- These should be prepared at least 5 days ahead of library prep. 
- Add 24 mL of 100% ethanol to the DNA Wash Buffer concentrate. Store at room temperature. 

### Best practices 

- Avoid multiple freeze thaws of all components, and aliquot components as necessary
- Remove enzymes from cold storage just before use and return to cold storage immediately after use
- Thaw and maintain all components on ice unless noted otherwise 
- Flick to mix thawed components and briefly centrifuge prior to use 
- After adding each component, mix by pipetting up and down 15-20 times. Briefly centrifuge after 
- Pre-program thermal cycler with lid heating ON set to >100-105Â°C 
- Turn on thermocycler day-of to preheat 
- Pre-calculate how much to dilute RNA samples 

### Protocol 

Protocol was followed according to this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-03-29-Zymo-SwitchFree.md). 

#### QC

Run [DNA Tapestation](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-30-DNA-Tapestation.md) to visualize libraries. Here's an example of what the library should look like on a Tapestation:

I ran the tapestation on the libraries on 1/30/25. See the full report XXXX

## Goals  

### Writing and manuscripts 
              
1. Submit Astrangia review to Coral Reefs
2. Full draft of dissertation proposal
3. Write full methods and results for Astrangia 2021 experiment 
4. Continue outlining histology manuscript intro 
5. Outline sections for E5 manuscript about descriptive ncRNAs

### Sample processing

1. RNA extractions for AH - HI 2023
2. Physiology processing for developmental time series 2023
	- Carbs
	- Lipids
	- Cell counts 
3. Initial cell counts for Astrangia 2021
	- Count 20 samples and see how variable they are after homogenizing 2x

### Data analysis 
1. E5 deep dive - lncRNA and miRNA
2. Astrangia mRNA analysis

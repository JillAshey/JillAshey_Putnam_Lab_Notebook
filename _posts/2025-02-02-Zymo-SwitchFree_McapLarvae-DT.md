# SwitchFree library prep test

This post details the info about the SwitchFree library prep. See Zymo's protocol [here](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_r3008_r3009__zymo_seq_switchfree_3_mrna_library_kit.pdf). 

I will be prepping my 32 Mcap DT 2023 samples (see project github [repo](https://github.com/JillAshey/DevelopmentalTimeseries) for more information about the experiment); today, I am prepping 12 samples: 6 new samples and 6 redos (see information about preps on [1/30/25](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2025-01-30-Zymo-SwitchFree_McapLarvae-DT.md) and [2/1/25](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2025-02-01-Zymo-SwitchFree_McapLarvae-DT.md). The 6 that I will be redoing did not do well in the [1/30/25](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2025-01-30-Zymo-SwitchFree_McapLarvae-DT.md) prep (M6, M7, M8, M14, M47, M86). 

I already sequenced these using rRNA depletion and smRNA sequencing but we are going to do polyA sequencing as well to better elucidate the MZT. The kit needs a minimum of 10 ng of total RNA or a maximum of 500 ng of total RNA, which is a large range. In my Ribofree and miRNA preps with the same samples, I used 190 and 100 ng per sample, respectively. I am going to use 100ng as input for this library prep.

I am using the Zymo UDI primers for these preps. See more information and barcode sequences [here](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-udi-primer-sets?srsltid=AfmBOoqmYVsF5dEMxwuwu7L6mn6Ot93O6ldOc9wwDwvXUhCkKhg0WK5Y). 

Here's the SwitchFree library prep workflow:

### Materials 

- [Zymo-Seq SwitchFree 3' mRNA Library Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-switchfree-3-mrna-library-kit)
- PCR tubes 
- Thermocycler 
- Mini centrifuge
- Aluminum beads (to keep things on ice)
- Magnetic stand for PCR tubes 
- Kit contents

### Buffer preperation 

Once buffers are prepared for a kit, they do not need to be prepared again. 

- Add 300 uL of the Select-a-Size MagBead concentrate to 10 mL of Select-a-Size MagBead Buffer. 
	- These should be prepared at least 5 days ahead of library prep. 
- Add 24 mL of 100% ethanol to the DNA Wash Buffer concentrate. Store at room temperature. 

### Best practices 

- Avoid multiple freeze thaws of all components, and aliquot components as necessary
- Remove enzymes from cold storage just before use and return to cold storage immediately after use
- Thaw and maintain all components on ice unless noted otherwise 
- Flick to mix thawed components and briefly centrifuge prior to use 
- After adding each component, mix by pipetting up and down 15-20 times. Briefly centrifuge after 
- Pre-program thermal cycler with lid heating ON set to >100-105Â°C 
- Turn on thermocycler day-of to preheat 
- Pre-calculate how much to dilute RNA samples 

### Protocol 

Protocol was followed according to this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-03-29-Zymo-SwitchFree.md). 

I eluted in 15 uL of DNA elution buffer ([previous prep](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2025-01-30-Zymo-SwitchFree_McapLarvae-DT.md) eluted in 20uL). 

#### QC

Run [DNA Tapestation](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-30-DNA-Tapestation.md) to visualize libraries. Here's an example of what the library should look like on a Tapestation:

I ran the tapestation on the libraries on 2/1/25. See the full report XXXX

## Goal: Determine chlorophyll-a in Astrangia samples from 2021 experiment 

This protocol was adapted from the [Putnam lab](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resources/Physiology_Protocols/Chlorophyll-Protocol.md), [Emma Strand](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-10-24-Chlorophyll-A-Protocol.md), and [Wall et al. 2018](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00227-018-3317-z.pdf).

### Materials & Equipment 

- 100% acetone 
- Quartz 96 well plate 
- Microcentrifuge 
- P1000 + tips 
- 1.5 mL tubes 
- Microplate reader 
- Gen5 software

### Protocol 

1. Thaw sample homogenate
2. Centrifuge the aliquot of adult homogenate for 3 minutes at 13,000 rpm to separate host and symbiont cells. 
3. Remove and discard supernatent. The pellet is the symbiont cells! 
4. Add 1 mL of 100% acetone to the pellet. Vortex the tubes for 15 seconds to mix. 
	- I also 'beat' the samples (i.e., shook them really fast on the Benchmark), as I wanted to dissolve the symbiont pellet as much as I could.
5. Put tubes in the 4°C fridge in the dark for 24 hours.
6. Make a plate map for samples.
7. The following day, take the tubes out of the fridge and vortex for 15 seconds. 
8. Spin tubes for 3 minutes at 13,000 rpm.
9. Using the quartz 96 well plate, pipette 200 µL of 100% acetone into duplicate wells to be used as blanks.
10. Pipette 200 µL of sample to duplicate wells of 96-well quartz plate.
11. Measure the extracted cholophyll-a concentration on the plate reader at 630, 663, and 750 nm.

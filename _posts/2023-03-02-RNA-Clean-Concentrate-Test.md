This protocol describes how to clean/concentrate RNA with the [Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/rna-clean-concentrator-5). 

### Materials & Equipment 

- Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator -5 kit
	- What you will need from kit:
		- RNA binding buffer 
		- RNA prep buffer 
		- RNA wash buffer 
		- DNase/RNase free water
		- Spin IC columns and collection tubes 
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Plastics 
	- 2 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample
	- 1 quibit tube per sample 
	- Several 1000 µL, 200 µL, and 20 µL filtered pipette tips per sample

### Samples 

Today, I tested out the RNA clean/concentrate kit on 4 of my samples with low RNA concentrations. I need 50 ng/µL to send to Azenta for RNA sequencing (small, long, mRNA). 

These were the samples I used: 

| Sample   | Avg RNA ng/µl | µg    | Extraction date |
| -------- | ------------- | ----- | --------------- |
| AST-2523 | 20.1          | 1.809 | 11/7/22         |
| AST-1065 | 16.3          | 1.467 | 11/7/22         |
| AST-1761 | 45.8          | 4.122 | 1/12/23         |
| AST-2403 | 30.6          | 2.754 | 1/16/23         |

Each sample had ~90 µL of RNA in the tube.

January 2024 goals and daily notebook entries. 

## Goals  

### Writing and manuscripts 
              
1. Full draft of dissertation proposal
2. Write full methods and physiological results for Astrangia 2021 experiment 
3. Revise and resubmit Astrangia review manuscript 
4. ICRS apps?
5. Comp sci fellowship app ?
6. Submit URI Dean Fellowship app 

### Sample processing

1. Send RNA for sequencing for AH HI 2023 project
2. Initial cell counts for Astrangia 2021
	- Count 20 samples and see how variable they are after homogenizing 2x
3. Extract Mcap dev timeseries samples 

### Data analysis
1. Finish stats for Astrangia 2021 phys data 
2. Work on Astrangia 2021 DEG analysis 
	- Redo mapping with bowtie 
	- See if I can figure out why DESeq2 code is being weird and not showing me all of the options for comparisons (maybe talk to Zoe)
3. Map and quantify Astrangia 2021 miRNAs 

## Daily log

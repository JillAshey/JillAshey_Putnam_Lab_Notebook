June 2025 goals and daily notebook entries.

## Goals

### Writing and manuscripts 

1. AST manuscript writing - results for mRNA-miRNA interactions (use 3'UTR or mRNA as miRNA binding site?)
2. CBASS paper 
3. Mcap 2023 writing - methods and results for polyA v ribofree 

### Sample processing

1. ENCORE library prep 
2. Train undergrads on airbrushing 
3. Carbs for Mcap and Fungia larvae 

### Data analysis

1. AHHHHHHH

### Field work / travel

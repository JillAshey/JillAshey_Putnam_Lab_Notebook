# Extractions for Mcap developmental time series Hawaii 2023

This protocol is based on Maggie’s coral egg/larvae extraction [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/) and Kevin’s coral larvae extraction [protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Extractions-on-P.-astreoides-larvae-BEAD-BEATING/). This post details the info about the extraction steps for the *M. capitata* developmental time series experiment in Hawaii 2023. The github for that project is linked [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/Hawaii_Developmental_TimeSeries). 

**Important changes in this protocol**: I did not add beads to samples for beating step and I used 300uL as my input volume instead of 500uL. See the bottom of this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-02-08-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae-DT.md) for reasoning behind those choices.  

### Samples 

The samples run today were M13, M23, M35, M52, M60, M72, and M85. These samples had between 300-1600 eggs/larvae per tube. Sample were preserved in 500 ul of DNA/RNA Shield. This photo is post-beating: 


I was originally going to extract M5 as well, but I spilled all of it on the ground post-beating. Good thing I collected n=6 samples per timepoint!


### Materials 

- Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit [HERE](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) Protocol Booklet
- Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1X buffer for DNA elution
- Heating block capable of heating to 70ºC
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Plastics 
	- 5 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample
	- 2 PCR tubes per sample
	- 2 Qubit tubes per sample 

### Protocol

Protocol was followed according to this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-07-21-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae.md). A few differences: 

- I added between 200-500 uL of DNA/RNA shield to the samples that had <1mL of shield in them after thawing them so that the volume in the tubes was 1 mL of shield. I aliquoted out 300 uL for extractions and saved the remaining fraction in case we need to re-extract. 
- I did not add beads when mixing the samples after they thawed. 
- In the RNA extraction, I added another wash step with 400 uL of wash buffer after the DNase incubation (i.e., after the incubation, I did 400 uL of prep buffer, 700 uL of wash buffer, 400 uL of wash buffer, and another 400 uL of wash buffer).
- I eluted in 80 uL of either Tris (DNA) or DNA/RNA free water (RNA) instead of 100 uL.

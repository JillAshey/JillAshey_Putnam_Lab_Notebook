## Goal: create and execute histology protocol

*Adapted from protocol by Dr. Beth Lenz*

#### Materials and Equipment 
- [50 mL falcon tubes](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/falcon-50ml-conical-centrifuge-tubes-2/p-193321)
- [500 mL containers](https://www.amazon.com/Containers-Stackable-Reusable-Plastic-Container/dp/B077G76C6J/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1O2K0TWGXLGA5&dchild=1&keywords=ziplock+containers+with+lids&qid=1613143193&sprefix=ziplock+c%2Caps%2C181&sr=8-6)
- [Zinc formalin fixative](https://www.mcssl.com/store/anatechltd/z-fix-4-gal-case)
- Ethanol
- Vaccum pump
- 0.2 μm filter
- Glass bottles
- Plastic jugs and bins
- Funnnel
- Personal Protective Equipment (glasses, lab coat, gloves)
- Cooler 

#### Protocol Steps 

##### 1) Select and record plug ID of corals to be fixed

Randomly choose a sample from each tank, and record the plug ID of the sample. Note how large the coral is -- this will determine what type of vessel (falcon tube or container) it will be put in for fixation.

##### 2) Prepare and label falcon tubes and containers.

Label should include plug ID, tank number, timepoint, species (AST = Astrangia), initials, and date. 

##### 3) Calculate total volume based on number of samples and types of vessels you need to fix with. 

40 mL per sample for falcon tubes; 400 mL per sample for containers 

##### 4) Filter seawater for fixative solution 

Choose a 0.2 μm filter. Set up the vaccum filter housing: water will be poured into the top, vaccummed through the filter, and deposited in the bottom container. 

Attach the hosing of the vaccum pump to the bottom container of the vaccum filter housing. Once hosing is secure, turn pump on and check dials to make sure there's enough pressure. 

When bottom container is full (~1 L), turn off the pump, wait for pressure to get to 0, and slowly remove hosing from filter housing. Pour the now-filtered seawater into a glass bottle. Repeat until enough is made for fixative. 

##### 5) Dilute Z-fix with filtered seawater (FSW) to a 1:4 of Z-fix:FSW

Put FSW water in hood. Get Z-fix from cabinet, put spigot on Z-fix container, and dispense enough needed for fixative. Pour desired amounts of FSW and Z-fix into  labelled plastic jug (use funnel if necessary). 

*Zfix (10% aqueous buffered zinc formalin) is very toxic!! Use full PPE while working with it. Make sure to have two people to take Z-fix container out of cabinet, as it is bulky and heavy.*

Read [Product Information](http://www.anatechltdusa.com/files/130912398.pdf) and [Safety Data Sheet](http://www.anatechltdusa.com/files/114169364.pdf) for Z-fix before use. 

##### 6) Prepare pre-labelled tubes and containers prior to sampling. Pour diluted Z-fix into individual falcon tubes and containers. 

For falcon tubes, add between 30-40 mL of fixative per tube. For containers, add 350-450 mL of fixative per container. 

##### 7) If transport is necessary, secure now-filled tubes and containers in a cooler with a formalin pad in it. 

##### 8) Collect and fix samples. 

Samples should be taken from tanks, removed from their individual plugs, and placed in specific tube/container. Carefully place sample in tube/container so the fixative does not splash.

If sample is not fully immersed in buffer, add more buffer until sample is fully immersed. 

##### 9) Store samples in a cool, dark place (currently in fridge for flammables) 

Samples can remain in Zfix for up to 6 months 

##### 10) Pour off Zfix and replace with ethanol

Pour Zfix from sample containers into a designated waste container (once waste container is full, fill out [this form](https://web.uri.edu/ehs/online-pickup/) to request hazardous waste pick-up). Refill the containers with the same volume of 70% ethanol. 

##### 10) Decalcify coral

Make a 10% hydrochloric acid solution in a plastic beaker/container and place coral in solution. The coral may bubble or fizz slightly. Leave the coral to decalcify - this may take several hours or days. 

To see expanded decalcification protocol, go [here](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2021-06-14-Decalcification.md).

##### 11) Once decalcification is complete, store tissue in falcon tube in 20% Z-fix. 

If necessary, examine the now-decalcified coral tissue under a dissecting microscope. To see the dissecting microscope protocol, go [here](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2021-06-24-Dissecting-Microscope.md). 

##### 12) Ship tissue to histology laboratory.

For the GSO Astrangia project, we used [Pacific Pathology](https://pacificpathology.com) for our histology needs. We requested serial section slides in H+E (Hemotoxylin and eosin stain). 

Make sure tissue is in 20% Z-fix solution (or 10% formalin) in a falcon tube before shipping. Wrap the top of the tube with parafilm and put the tube in two zip-lock bags.

## Goals  

### Writing and manuscripts 
              
1. Full draft of dissertation proposal
2. Write physiological results for Astrangia 2021 experiment 
3. Resubmit Astrangia review manuscript 
4. Finish intro and methods for e5 ncRNA paper 
5. Methods + results for Pacuta paper 

### Sample processing

1. Extractions + 3' mRNA library prep with POC samples 
2. Library prep for WGBS (27 samples)
3. Carbs for DT samples 

### Data analysis

1. Finish stats for Astrangia 2021 phys data (carbs)
2. Complete Astrangia 2021 mRNA functional enrichment analysis 
3. Run miranda with genes of interest, invoking strict seed binding
4. Assemble mito genome for Apul 
5. Assemble coral genome for Apul 
6. Run miranda with lncRNAs 
7. Run DEG analysis with lncRNAs

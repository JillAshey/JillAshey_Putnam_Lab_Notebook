# Extractions for Astrangia 2021 experiment

This protocol is based on those from [E. Strand](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-05-31-Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol.md), [K. Wong](https://github.com/kevinhwong1/KevinHWong_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-03-13-Zymo-DNA-RNA-Extract-P.astreoides-Genome.md), [E. Chille](https://echille.github.io/E.-Chille-Open-Lab-Notebook/Protocol-for-DNA-RNA-Extractions-of-Montipora-Coral-Larvae-Using-Zymo-Duet-Extraction-Kit/), [K. Terpis](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/), & [Z. Delleart](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/). 

### Samples 

Samples that I used today: 

- AST-2198
- AST-1185
- AST-2301
- AST-1182
- AST-1761
- AST-1719
- AST-1343
- AST-1087
- AST-1290
- AST-1698

Samples were flash frozen, clipped, and put in 1.5 mL bead tube in 1 mL of DNA/RNA shield.

### Materials 

- Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit [HERE](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) Protocol Booklet
- Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1X buffer for DNA elution
- Heating block capable of heating to 70ºC
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Plastics 
	- 5 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample
	- 2 PCR tubes per sample
	- Several 1000 uL, 200 uL, and 20 uL filtered pipette tips per sample.

### Protocol 

Before extractions, I bead beat samples, as they were already in bead tubes

- Bead beat for 1 minute at max speed 
- Quick spin down in smol centrifuge 
- Transfer 400 μL into new tube. 
- Centrifuge for 3 minutes at 9000 rct
- Transfer 300 μL into new tube

Used this [protocol](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2022-10-25-MiniprepPlus-DNA:RNA-extractions.md) (mine) for extractions and QC. 

### Quality Control 

QC was done the following day (1/13/23).

#### Gel

Two samples (AST-2198 and AST-1719) did not have any detectable DNA, but both had a good amount of RNA. The bands in the gel for both DNA samples were bright so maybe it was an error in my Qubit loading. Other than that, samples look good!

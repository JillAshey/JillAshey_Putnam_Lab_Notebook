September 2023 goals and daily notebook entries. 

## Goals  

### Writing and manuscripts 
              
1. Write methods for histology manuscript
2. Re-submit sediment stress to PeerJ
3. Submit Astrangia review to Coral Reefs
4. Full draft of dissertation proposal

### Sample processing

1. RNA extractions for AH - HI 2023
2. Physiology processing for developmental time series 2023
	- Carbs
	- Lipids
	- Proteins 
	- Cell counts 
3. Initial cell counts for Astrangia 2021
	- Count 20 samples and see how variable they are after homogenizing 2x

### Data analysis 
1. E5 deep dive - lncRNA and miRNA
2. Astrangia mRNA analysis

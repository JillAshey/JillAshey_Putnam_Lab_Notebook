# SwitchFree library prep test

This post details the info about the SwitchFree library prep steps. Hollie got this kit as a test to see if we can produce adequate libraries for RNA sequencing with different species. I'm using the [Zymo-Seq SwitchFree 3' mRNA Library Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-switchfree-3-mrna-library-kit). See Zymo's protocol [here](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_r3008_r3009__zymo_seq_switchfree_3_mrna_library_kit.pdf). 

We will be using samples 8, 9, 106, 109, 111, and 112 from the POC 2023 spawning project. These samples were extracted on [3/27/24](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-03-27-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-Poc2023.md). The kit needs a minimum of 10 ng of total RNA or a maximum of 500 ng of total RNA, which is a large range. Since some of the concentrations in these samples were low, we will be using 11 ng of total RNA as input. Here's a breakdown of input RNA volumes for each sample: 


| TubeID | TS RNA (ng/uL) | Strip tube # | RNA (uL) | Ultrapure water (uL) | Total starting volume (ul) | Primer |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------ |
| 8      | 15.9           | 1            | 0.7      | 4.3                 | 5.0                        | 7      |
| 9      | 23.2           | 2           | 0.5      | 4.5                 | 5.0                        | 8     |
| 106    | 7.29           | 3            | 1.5      | 3.5                  | 5.0                        | 9      |
| 109    | 8.71           | 4            | 1.3      | 3.7                  | 5.0                        | 10      |
| 111    | 7.23           | 5            | 1.5      | 3.5                  | 5.0                        | 11     |
| 112    | 6.27           | 6            | 1.8      | 3.2                  | 5.0                        | 12     |

### Materials 

- [Zymo-Seq SwitchFree 3' mRNA Library Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-switchfree-3-mrna-library-kit)
- PCR tubes 
- Thermocycler 
- Mini centrifuge
- Aluminum beads (to keep things on ice)
- Magnetic stand for PCR tubes 
- Kit contents

### Buffer preperation 

Once buffers are prepared for a kit, they do not need to be prepared again. 

- Add 300 uL of the Select-a-Size MagBead concentrate to 10 mL of Select-a-Size MagBead Buffer. 
	- These should be prepared at least 5 days ahead of library prep. 
- Add 24 mL of 100% ethanol to the DNA Wash Buffer concentrate. Store at room temperature. 

### Best practices 

- Avoid multiple freeze thaws of all components, and aliquot components as necessary
- Remove enzymes from cold storage just before use and return to cold storage immediately after use
- Thaw and maintain all components on ice unless noted otherwise 
- Flick to mix thawed components and briefly centrifuge prior to use 
- After adding each component, mix by pipetting up and down 15-20 times. Briefly centrifuge after 
- Pre-program thermal cycler with lid heating ON set to >100-105Â°C 
- Turn on thermocycler day-of to preheat 
- Pre-calculate how much to dilute RNA samples 

### Protocol 

Protocol was followed according to this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-03-29-Zymo-SwitchFree.md). 

Sections 1 and 2 were done on 4/4/24. Section 3 was done on 4/5/24. 

#### QC

Run [DNA Tapestation](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-30-DNA-Tapestation.md) to visualize libraries. Here's an example of what the library should look like on a Tapestation:

I ran the tapestation on the libraries on 4/5/24. See the full report [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/tapestation/DNA_switchfree_POC_2024-04-05.pdf).

Tapestation peaks and concentrations look great for all samples! All of the samples have a slight shoulder to the right, which might indicate PCR bubbles (read more [here](https://knowledge.illumina.com/library-preparation/general/library-preparation-general-reference_material-list/000001918)). Libraries with a bubble product can still be sequenced, which is good. I discussed with Hollie and we will move forward with sequencing. I will provide Genohub with the tapestation results, as well as the Zymo manual.

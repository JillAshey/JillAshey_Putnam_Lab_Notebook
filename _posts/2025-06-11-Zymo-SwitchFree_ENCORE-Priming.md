# SwitchFree library prep

This post details the info about the SwitchFree library prep. See Zymo's protocol [here](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_r3008_r3009__zymo_seq_switchfree_3_mrna_library_kit.pdf). 

I will be prepping samples from Flo's ENCORE priming experiment conducted in Bermuda 2024 (see github [repo](https://github.com/flofields/Coral_Priming_Experiments_Summer_2024) for more information on the experiment). Today, I am prepping 2 Mdec samples - one sample (MDec-D1) from the ENCORE TPC that Federica successfully prepped with this kit (see her [post](https://github.com/FScucchia-LabNotebooks/FScucchia_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/a5378f473df0cbcee7da71b6b0a1e56ab5c85d8e/_posts/2024-11-21-LibraryPrep-ZymoSwitch-Hawaii-TPCA.md)) and one sample (MD-5-7) from the ENCORE priming experiment. Federica and Flo have attempted to prep other Mdec samples, but none have worked so far. 

The kit needs a minimum of 10 ng of total RNA or a maximum of 500 ng of total RNA, which is a large range. We will be using 11 ng of total RNA as input. Here's a breakdown of input RNA volumes for each sample:

| TubeID | Qubit RNA avg (ng/uL) | Strip tube # | RNA (uL) | Ultrapure water (uL) | Total starting volume (ul) | Primer |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------ |
| MDec-D1      | 27.3           | 1            | 0.5      | 4.5                 | 5.0                        | XX      |
| MD-5-7      | 19.2           | 2           | 0.6      | 4.4                 | 5.0                        | XX     |

Here's the SwitchFree library prep workflow:

### Materials 

- [Zymo-Seq SwitchFree 3' mRNA Library Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zymo-seq-switchfree-3-mrna-library-kit)
- PCR tubes 
- Thermocycler 
- Mini centrifuge
- Aluminum beads (to keep things on ice)
- Magnetic stand for PCR tubes 
- Kit contents

### Buffer preperation 

Once buffers are prepared for a kit, they do not need to be prepared again. 

- Add 300 uL of the Select-a-Size MagBead concentrate to 10 mL of Select-a-Size MagBead Buffer. 
	- These should be prepared at least 5 days ahead of library prep. 
- Add 24 mL of 100% ethanol to the DNA Wash Buffer concentrate. Store at room temperature. 

### Best practices 

- Avoid multiple freeze thaws of all components, and aliquot components as necessary
- Remove enzymes from cold storage just before use and return to cold storage immediately after use
- Thaw and maintain all components on ice unless noted otherwise 
- Flick to mix thawed components and briefly centrifuge prior to use 
- After adding each component, mix by pipetting up and down 15-20 times. Briefly centrifuge after 
- Pre-program thermal cycler with lid heating ON set to >100-105Â°C 
- Turn on thermocycler day-of to preheat 
- Pre-calculate how much to dilute RNA samples 

### Protocol 

Protocol was followed according to this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-03-29-Zymo-SwitchFree.md). 

### QC

Run [DNA Tapestation](https://github.com/meschedl/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-07-30-DNA-Tapestation.md) to visualize libraries. Here's an example of what the library should look like on a Tapestation:

I ran the tapestation on the libraries on XXXXX. See the full report [here](XXXXX).

# Extractions for Mcap developmental time series Hawaii 2023

This protocol is based on Maggie’s coral egg/larvae extraction [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/) and Kevin’s coral larvae extraction [protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/DNA-RNA-Extractions-on-P.-astreoides-larvae-BEAD-BEATING/). This post details the info about the extraction steps for the *M. capitata* developmental time series experiment in Hawaii 2023. The github for that project is linked [here](https://github.com/JillAshey/Hawaii_Developmental_TimeSeries). 

### Samples 

The samples run today were a mix of new and previously extracted samples. M6, M7, M8 and M9 were all new. I did not add beads to these samples for beating step and I used 300uL as my input volume instead of 500uL. See the bottom of this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-02-08-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae-DT.md) for reasoning behind those choices.  

M10, M11, M12, M14, M15, M24, M26, M28, M47, M48, M49, M50, M51, and M83 were all samples that I had extracted previously using the bead beating method and taking 500 uL as input. In this round of (re)extractions, I took 300 uL of input from these samples. These samples had already been bead beaten from previous extractions. These samples had between 300-1600 eggs/larvae per tube and were preserved in 500 ul of DNA/RNA Shield.

### Materials 

- Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit [HERE](https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d7003t_d7003_quick-dna-rna_miniprep_plus_kit.pdf) Protocol Booklet
- Tris-Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1X buffer for DNA elution
- Heating block capable of heating to 70ºC
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- Plastics 
	- 5 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes per sample
	- 2 PCR tubes per sample
	- 2 Qubit tubes per sample 

### Protocol

Protocol was followed according to this [post](https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-07-21-MiniprepPlus-DNA%3ARNA-extractions-McapLarvae.md). A few differences: 

- I added between 200-500 uL of DNA/RNA shield to the new samples that had <1mL of shield in them after thawing them so that the volume in the tubes was 1 mL of shield. I aliquoted out 300 uL for extractions and saved the remaining fraction in case we need to re-extract. 
- I did not add beads when mixing the samples after they thawed for the newly extracted samples. Samples that were being re-extracted already had beads. 
- In the RNA extraction, I added another wash step with 400 uL of wash buffer after the DNase incubation (i.e., after the incubation, I did 400 uL of prep buffer, 700 uL of wash buffer, 400 uL of wash buffer, and another 400 uL of wash buffer).
- I eluted in 80 uL of either Tris (DNA) or DNA/RNA free water (RNA) instead of 100 uL.

#### Gel

The gel doesn't look great...Need to compare to other gels with 500 uL input + bead beating.
